# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][type][rust] `rpc::domain::transaction::TransactionRecord` gained a non-public field, so it can no longer be constructed with a struct literal outside the crate ([#2300](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2300)).
* [BREAKING][rust] `StateSyncUpdate` is now immutable once built: its `block_num`, `partial_blockchain_updates`, `note_updates`, `transaction_updates` and `account_updates` fields are private and it no longer implements `Default`. Build one with `StateSyncUpdate::from_parts`, read it through the same-named accessors, and take ownership of the contents with `into_parts` ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `PartialBlockchainUpdates::insert` no longer takes the block's MMR authentication nodes; stage them separately with the new `extend_authentication_nodes` ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [BREAKING][rust] Transaction inputs are now sealed before submission. The client fetches the validator set's shared encryption key on first submission and verifies its validator attestations against the validator set committed in the chain tip before using it. A client must be synced far enough to have a genesis header and a chain-tip header locally before it can submit. `NodeRpcClient::submit_proven_transaction` and `NodeRpcClient::submit_proven_batch` now take `SealedTransactionInputs` instead of `TransactionInputs`.
* [BREAKING][rename][rust] `NoteScreener::can_consume` → `NoteScreener::get_consumability` and `NoteScreener::can_consume_batch` → `NoteScreener::get_batch_consumability`. The new names reflect that both return a `NoteConsumptionStatus` per account rather than a boolean ([#2338](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2338)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] Transaction inputs are now encrypted on submission, so the RPC operator relaying them cannot read them. `Client::submit_proven_transaction` seals the inputs against the validator set's shared transaction encryption key: on first use it fetches the key from the node, verifies a validator attestation for it against the validator set committed in a trusted block header (binding the genesis commitment, so an attestation cannot be replayed from another network), and caches the verified key in the store's settings table, evicting it when the node rejects a submission sealed against a retired key so the next submission re-fetches. Requires a node that unseals submitted inputs; such nodes reject plaintext submissions ([#2341](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2341)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient` models encrypted submissions: `submit_proven_transaction` now takes `SealedTransactionInputs` instead of `TransactionInputs`, `submit_proven_batch` now takes `Vec<SealedTransactionInputs>` (one per transaction, each sealed against its own transaction ID), and implementations must provide the new `get_transaction_encryption_key` method ([#2341](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2341)).
* [BREAKING][removal][cli] Removed the `account --show --with-code` flag. Use `account --inspect <ID> --verbose` to view procedure disassembly. ([#2312](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2312)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `NoteFilter::ScriptRoots` variant, so exhaustive matches on `NoteFilter` in `Store` implementations must handle it ([#2335](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2335)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] The SQLite base schema now declares an index on `input_notes(script_root)`. This changes the schema fingerprint, so opening a database created before this change fails with `SchemaHashMismatch` and existing stores must be recreated ([#2335](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2335)).

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] A client that only watches a public account now recovers notes the account consumed authenticated, even when it never tracked them by tag. During sync it reads the note references the node attaches to the account's transactions, fetches each note body by id, and surfaces it through `InputNoteReader`. Requires node `0.15.1` ([#2300](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2300)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added a `--payback-note-type` option to `swap` so the payback note can be created as public or private (defaults to private). Public payback works without any off-band advice now that SWAP derives the payback recipient deterministically ([#2190](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2190)).
* [FEATURE][rust] `Client::get_consumable_notes(Some(account_id))` now screens only that account instead of screening every tracked account and discarding the rest, so its cost no longer grows with the number of tracked accounts. Added `NoteScreener::get_batch_consumability_for_account` to screen notes against a single account ([#2338](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2338)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added the `miden_client::rpc::encryption` module backing encrypted submissions: `TransactionEncryptionKey`, `AttestedTransactionEncryptionKey` (whose `verify` is the only path to a usable key), `ValidatorAttestation`, `NextTransactionEncryptionKey`, `SealedTransactionInputs` and `seal_transaction_inputs`, along with re-exports of the validator DSA key types reachable from this API ([#2341](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2341)).
* [FEATURE][rust,store] Added `NoteFilter::ScriptRoots` to query input notes by their note script root directly at the store level, without loading and screening unrelated notes. The filter doesn't apply to output notes: querying output notes with it returns an empty list ([#2335](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2335)).
* [rust] Added `PartialBlockchainUpdates::block_headers_to_store`, which narrows the staged headers to the ones a sync must persist: those marked as relevant, genesis, and the block at the sync height. `block_headers` still yields all staged headers ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [rust] State sync now authenticates every relevant note block but only persists block headers and MMR authentication nodes for blocks containing notes that remain unspent or that a `NoteObserver` explicitly marks as relevant ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added `account --inspect <ID>[:<PROCEDURE>]` to list the procedures an account exposes, grouped into resolved procedures (with their names and signatures) and unresolved ones (listed by MAST root). Names and signatures are resolved from the `.masp` packages in the configured packages directory plus any passed via `--package` (`-p`). `--verbose` prints each procedure's MASM disassembly. ([#2312](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2312)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added `package inspect <FILE.masp>` to print a package's name, version, digest, target type and description, followed by tables of its exported procedures (with signatures and MAST roots), its non-procedure exports, and its dependencies. `--verbose` (`-v`) additionally prints each exported procedure's MASM disassembly. The package is read on its own, so the command needs neither an initialized client nor a node connection.
* Improved the output of the `miden-client init` command when a configuration already exists ([#](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2357)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added DAP-based transaction debugging with offline record/replay. `miden-client exec` and `consume-notes` accept `--start-debug-adapter <ADDR>` to run a transaction — script, kernel, note scripts, and account code — under a DAP client (e.g. the `miden-debug` TUI) instead of proving and submitting it (`consume-notes` is backed by a new `Client::execute_transaction_with_dap`). During the session the advice mutations produced by the transaction host's event handlers are recorded — readable via the handle from `DapConfig::record_event_mutations()`, and reported by the CLI — and `--record <FILE>` writes a self-contained replay snapshot (program, inputs, resolved code, and event log) that can be replayed offline with `miden-debug --replay <FILE>`, with no node, client, or account state. This uses the `miden-debug` 0.9.2 release ([#2306](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2306)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][cli] `miden-client init` now reports invalid remote prover endpoints instead of silently writing a local-prover config ([#2376](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2376)).

## 0.16.0-alpha.1 (2026-07-17)

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][rust] `NodeRpcClient` implementations are now raw transports: the echo checks that verified node responses against the request moved from `GrpcClient` into the new `VerifyingRpcClient` wrapper. `ClientBuilder::grpc_client` and the network constructors wrap their gRPC client automatically; clients passed via `ClientBuilder::rpc` are used as provided, so wrap them in `VerifyingRpcClient` to keep verified responses ([#2278](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2278)).
* [BREAKING][rust][cli] Removed the client debug-mode toggle: `DebugMode`, `ClientBuilder::in_debug_mode`, `Client::in_debug_mode`, the CLI `--debug` flag, and the `MIDEN_DEBUG` environment variable are gone, along with the `debug_mode` parameter of `CliClient::new`/`CliClient::from_config`. Miden VM 0.24 replaced the flag-gated `debug.*` MASM decorators with `miden::core::debug` procedures whose output the transaction executor prints by default, so the toggle no longer had anything to gate. ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [BREAKING][rust] Migrated to `miden-protocol` 0.16. Transaction-level fees were removed, block-level `FeeParameters` are unchanged. The relative `AccountDelta` model was replaced by the absolute `AccountPatch` model for account updates: `TransactionResult::account_delta` is now `account_patch`, `AccountUpdateDetails::Public` now carries an `AccountPatch`, account reconstruction is done via `Account::try_from(&AccountPatch)` or `Account::apply_patch` instead of previous `apply_delta`. Re-exports changed accordingly: `AccountStorageDelta` for `AccountStoragePatch`, `StorageMapDelta` for `StorageMapPatch`, and so on. Standards APIs were updated: `AuthMethod` was removed (use the concrete auth components), `create_fungible_faucet` was replaced by auth-specific variants such as `create_singlesig_user_fungible_faucet`. ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [BREAKING][rust][cli] Fungible amounts in the public API now use `AssetAmount` instead of raw `u64`: `AccountReader::get_balance` returns `AssetAmount`, `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_pswap_consume` takes `AssetAmount` fill amounts, and `tokens_to_base_units`/`base_units_to_tokens` parse to and display from `AssetAmount` (amounts above `AssetAmount::MAX` are now rejected at parse time with `TokenParseError::InvalidAmount`) ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [BREAKING][rename][cli] Renamed the `send` subcommand to `transfer` (behavior and flags unchanged) ([#2311](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2311)).
* [BREAKING][store] The SQLite store now stores account IDs as serialized `BLOB` columns instead of hex `TEXT` ([#2309](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2309)).
* [BREAKING][param][store] `Store::insert_block_header` now takes a `nodes` argument and persists the header with its MMR authentication nodes in a single transaction; the standalone `Store::insert_partial_blockchain_nodes` is removed. Header-only inserts (e.g. genesis) pass an empty slice ([#2294](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2294)).
* [BREAKING][rust] Removed `Client::fetch_all_private_notes`. The automatic per-tag backfill on sync replaces it, so callers no longer reset the cursor and re-fetch every tag after adding a tag or importing an account. ([#2258](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2258))
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] The `ConsumedExternal` note-metadata layout added in [#2308](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2308) is now the only supported serialized format. The backward-compatible decoding of the older metadata-less layout is removed, so existing stores are not compatible and must be recreated ([#2313](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2313)).

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Note screening (`Client::get_consumable_notes`, `Client::note_screener`) now memoizes transaction-input and vault (fee) witness lookups for the duration of a single screening pass. This only affects notes whose consumability cannot be determined statically, which are the ones screened by running a trial transaction: they no longer re-read the same account and reference-block data from the store for every note. Verdicts are still not retained between calls. The `get_consumable_notes` docs now also describe its cost and point to cheaper store-query alternatives ([#2326](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2326)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][rust] Historical private notes for a newly tracked tag are now backfilled automatically on sync. `Client::sync_note_transport` diffs the tracked note tags against a persisted covered set and drains each newly tracked tag from the start, fetching only that tag's own history rather than re-scanning every tag. ([#2258](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2258))

### Changes

* [rust] Re-exported new upstream types reachable from the public API: `ExpirationTransactionScript` and `SendNotesTransactionScriptError` from `miden_client::transaction`, `NoteSyncHint` from `miden_client::note`, `StorageValuePatch` and `StorageMapPatchEntries` from `miden_client::account`, and `FeeParameters` and `ValidatorKeys` from `miden_client::block`. ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][cli] `init` now reports a dedicated error when a configuration file already exists, hinting at `clear-config` instead of suggesting `init`, which the shared config-error hint did ([#2366](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2366)).
* [FIX][store] Opening a `SQLite` store now fingerprints the live database schema and compares it against the schema its migrations produce, rejecting a database whose schema has drifted (manual DDL, a partially applied migration, or corruption) instead of trusting a hash stored inside the database file ([#2304](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2304)).
* [FIX][rust] Notes received over the note transport layer now fetch attachments from the node via `get_notes_by_id`. Fetched attachment content is verified against the note metadata's attachments commitment; a note whose advertised attachment content the node cannot serve (or serves incorrectly) is skipped with a warning instead of failing the sync, and a note record is never stored with incomplete attachment content ([#2295](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2295)).
* [FIX][store] The SQLite store now honors `StorageMapPatch` create/remove semantics: a `Create` patch on an existing map slot clears the prior entries before writing (so its root reflects only the created entries) and a `Remove` patch drops the slot's entries and collapses its root to the empty-map root ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [FIX][rust] Storing an authenticated block header now persists the header and its MMR authentication nodes in a single store transaction, so an interrupted write can no longer leave a tracked block without the MMR nodes needed to rebuild the `PartialMmr` ([#2294](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2294)).
* [FIX][rust] RPC endpoint parsing now rejects endpoint strings that omit either the protocol or host. ([#2266](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2266))
* [FIX][rust] State sync now re-verifies a tracked private account's commitment mismatch against the witness `get_account` returns. The witness is checked against the synced block's account root before locking the account, so a node can no longer durably lock it with a forged `sync_transactions` commitment ([#2260](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2260)).
* [FIX][rust] State sync now range-checks `sync_transactions` records to `(current, chain_tip]`, rejecting out-of-range records that could forge transaction commit heights ([#2252](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2252)).
* [FIX][rust] `Endpoint` parsing now strips a trailing slash from the host of no-port endpoints such as `http://host/`, matching the cleanup already applied when a port is present ([#2268](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2268)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_block_header_by_number` and `get_block_by_number` now reject responses whose block number does not match the requested one with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2270](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2270)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_notes_by_id` now rejects responses containing a note whose ID was not requested with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2283](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2283)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_nullifiers` now rejects responses containing a nullifier whose prefix was not requested with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2282](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2282)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_notes` now rejects responses containing a note whose tag was not requested with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2284](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2284)).
* [FIX][rust] Public account sync now binds `get_account` responses to the SyncMMR target block, rejecting snapshots from a different block, account, or account root ([#2255](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2255)).

## 0.15.4 (2026-07-16)

### Changes

* [rust] Bumped dependencies: Miden VM crates (`miden-core`, `miden-processor`, `miden-prover`, `miden-assembly`, etc.) to `0.23.5`, and `miden-node-proto-build` and `miden-remote-prover-client` to `0.15.1` ([#2301](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2301)).
* [cli] Documented the `call` command in the CLI docs ([#2317](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2317)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][rust] Added `is_inclusion_pending` to `InputNoteRecord` and `OutputNoteRecord` ([#2323](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2323)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][store] Add metadata to ConsumedExternal notes so that they can be findable by their `NoteId`. The change is store-compatible because records written by older clients (the metadata-less layout) still decode, reading back with no metadata as before ([#2308](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2308)).
* [FIX][rust,store] Output notes no longer register note tags, which leaked one row per created note; a store migration prunes the previously leaked tags ([#2323](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2323)).
* [FIX][rust] Public account sync now pins `get_account` to the sync target block (backport of [#2255](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2255)); an unpinned fetch could discard the client's own just-committed transaction as `Superseded`, permanently wedging the account.
* [FIX][rpc] Align `AddTransactionError` app-level codes with the node's `MempoolSubmissionError`, so submit-transaction failures report the correct cause (e.g. an account commitment mismatch is no longer misreported as "unauthenticated notes not found") and the node's message is preserved for state conflicts ([#2320](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2320)).

## 0.15.3 (2026-07-02)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][cli] `miden-cli call` now accepts advice map entries supplied via `--inputs-path/-i <FILE.toml>` in the same TOML format as `exec` ([#2244](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2244)).
* [FEATURE][rust] The gRPC client now accepts responses up to 15% above the node's 4 MiB payload budget by default, and `GrpcClient::with_max_decoding_message_size` lets callers raise the decode ceiling further. The CLI raises its own ceiling to 6 MiB to cover large `SyncTransactions` responses. This prevents syncs from failing with a "decoded message length too large" error when a node response slightly exceeds the previous hard 4 MiB limit ([#2298](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2299)).

## 0.15.2 (2026-06-18)

### Features

* [FEATURE][rust] Added PSWAP chain tracking: the client now follows a local creator's partial-swap order across foreign partial fills during sync, surfacing each reconstructed payback as a consumable input note and letting the creator reclaim the current tip. New `Client` API: `pswap_lineages`, `pswap_lineages_for`, `pswap_active_lineages`, `pswap_lineage`, and `build_pswap_cancel_by_order` ([#2231](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2231)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::send_private_note_with_block_hint`, which relays a sender-provided `after_block_num` so recipients get deterministic delivery instead of relying on receiving side lookback. ([#2262](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2262))

### Changes

* [rust] Bumped `miden-note-transport-proto-build` to `0.4.1`. Notes imported from the note transport layer now use the provided `after_block_num` when present, falling back to the 20-block lookback window otherwise. `NoteInfo` gained a `block_hint: Option<BlockNumber>` field (plus a `NoteInfo::new` constructor) and `NoteTransportClient` gained a `send_note_with_block_hint` method (defaulting to `send_note`, so existing implementors keep compiling).  ([#2262](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2262))

## 0.15.1 (2026-06-16)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Re-exported `miden-agglayer` as `miden_client::agglayer`. ([#2253](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2253))

## 0.15.0 (2026-06-12)

### Fixes

* [FIX][rust] `Client::execute_transaction` no longer writes to the store before execution: the request's input notes and output note scripts are persisted only after the transaction executes successfully and is applied, so a failed execution leaves the store unchanged ([#2222](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2222)).
* [FIX][rust] `Client::send_private_note` is now durable across transient NTL failures: the relay payload is persisted to a durable outbox (a `Vec<NoteInfo>` under the `note_transport_outbox` settings key) before the transport call, so a failed or interrupted `send_note` no longer drops the note. `Client::sync_note_transport` retries the outbox on each sync (the receiver dedupes by note id) and a failing relay no longer blocks the sync; the new `Client::flush_relay_outbox()` lets callers drive retries directly ([#2127](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2127)).
* [FIX] Fixed `derive_account_commitments` to return the final account commitment when multiple transactions for the same account are committed in the same block ([#2164](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2164)).
* [FIX] Stopped state sync from aborting when the node reports a stale (non-monotonic) header for a rapidly-advancing account: such updates are now skipped instead of failing with a nonce error ([#2216](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2216)).
* [FIX] Preserve a fungible asset's callback flag when the store replays a vault delta, fixing a `ConflictingRoots` error when consuming callback-bearing (e.g. agglayer-minted) assets ([#2225](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2225)).
* [FIX] Fixed the `sync_notes_with_details` to fetch the attachments for private notes ([#2214](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2214)).
* [rust] Expanded validation for output notes before executing a `TransactionRequest`. ([#89](https://github.com/0xMiden/wallet-adapter/issues/89))
* [FIX][rust] `Client::fetch_all_private_notes` now drains the full backlog across multiple server-paginated responses instead of returning after a single batch. Needed once the note-transport server (`0xMiden/note-transport-service#77`) caps each `fetch_notes` response at `FETCH_NOTES_BATCH_SIZE` rows — previously the function silently returned only the first batch, contradicting its documented "fetches all notes" semantics. Companion deterministic regression test (`fetch_all_private_notes_drains_across_batches`) uses a new `MockNoteTransportNode::with_max_batch(n)` constructor to exercise multi-batch drain. ([#2095](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2095))
* [FIX][rust] Fixed the `dap` feature build by bumping `miden-debug`/`miden-debug-engine` to 0.8.1 and `miden-core` to 0.23.2, aligning the debugger crates with the `miden-core` APIs they call. ([#2189](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2189))

### Changes

* [BREAKING][rust] Added a `Subscription(Word)` variant to `NoteTagSource`. ([#2248](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2248))
* [rust] Added `Store::apply_settings_mutations` for batched `settings` writes. ([#2248](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2248))
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_block_by_number()` now takes an `include_proof: bool` parameter to control whether the block proof is included in the response. ([#1991](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1991))
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_chain_mmr()` replaced `block_to: Option<BlockNumber>` with `upper_bound: SyncTarget` to match the RPC definition. Use `SyncTarget::CommittedChainTip` for previous default behavior (`None`), or `SyncTarget::BlockNumber(num)` for a specific block number. ([#1991](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1991))
* [BREAKING][rust] Added `submit_proven_batch` to `NodeRpcClient` trait. ([#2075](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2075))
* [BREAKING][param][cli] `address add` now takes `<ACCOUNT_ID> <BECH32_ADDRESS>` instead of `<ACCOUNT_ID> <INTERFACE> [TAG_LEN]`. Use the new `address encode` subcommand to build a bech32 string from `<ACCOUNT_ID> <INTERFACE> [TAG_LEN]`. ([#2115](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2115))
* [BREAKING][rust] `StateSync` no longer takes an `Option<Arc<dyn Store>>`. `StateSyncInput::accounts` is now a `Vec<AccountSyncHint>` (header + `AccountStorageHeader`); when hints cover the account's map slots `StateSync` issues a single `get_account_proof` for non-oversized accounts, and when new map slots appear on-chain it only fetches the missing ones. The `Store` trait method `get_account_map_slot_names` was replaced with `get_account_storage_header`. ([#2132](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2132))
* [BREAKING] `NodeRpcClient::get_account_details` now fetches a public account's storage maps in a single `/GetAccount` request and returns `Option<Account>`. No longer returns data for private accounts; instead use `NodeRpcClient::get_account` to fetch private account's commitment. ([#2215](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2215)).
* [BREAKING] Removed the account storage-layout sync hints; `StateSyncInput::accounts` now takes a `Vec<AccountHeader>` ([#2215](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2215)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `BasicFungibleFaucet` is now a unit struct; token symbol/decimals/max-supply moved to a new `FungibleTokenMetadata` component built via `FungibleTokenMetadata::builder`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][behavior][cli] `account new-faucet` now requires a `[fungible-faucet-metadata]` block (typed `symbol`, `decimals`, `max_supply`, optional `name`) in the init data file passed via `-i`, replacing the previous `["miden::standards::fungible_faucets::metadata"]` section with stringly-typed values. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][behavior][all] Note scripts must now use the package-style header `@note_script` + `pub proc main … end` instead of the bare `begin … end`, following the upstream protocol bump. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Token-policy components in `account::component` were redesigned: removed `MintAuthControlled`, `MintOwnerControlled`, `BurnAuthControlled`, `BurnOwnerControlled` (and their `*Config` variants); faucets now install a single `TokenPolicyManager` configured with `PolicyAuthority` + `MintPolicyConfig` / `BurnPolicyConfig`, plus standalone `MintAllowAll` / `MintOwnerOnly` / `BurnAllowAll` / `BurnOwnerOnly` policy components. Construct via `AccountBuilder::with_components(TokenPolicyManager::new(...))`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `NoteScript::root()` now returns `NoteScriptRoot` instead of `Word`. Use `Word::from(root)` (or `root.into()`) where a `Word` is required. `NoteScriptRoot` is re-exported from `miden_client::note`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][rename][rust] `FeeParameters::native_asset_id()` renamed to `fee_faucet_id()`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][rust] Removed `NodeRpcClient::check_nullifiers`, `RpcEndpoint::CheckNullifiers`, `EndpointError::CheckNullifiers`, and `CheckNullifiersError` after the upstream node dropped the `CheckNullifiers` gRPC method. Use `NodeRpcClient::sync_nullifiers` to retrieve nullifier updates. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][behavior][cli] `token_symbol_map.toml` requires the `id` field to be a bech32 address; hex `AccountId`s are no longer accepted. Convert existing entries by copying the bech32 address from `account list`. ([#2159](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2159))
* Added a `Client::import_watched_account_by_id` method to track an external account state without syncing notes ([#2143](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2143)).
* Removed limit on accounts and note tags that can be tracked by the client ([#2170](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2170)).
* [BREAKING] Updated the `sync_notes` and `sync_transactions` to return directly the fetched updates. Removed `TransactionsInfo` and `NoteSyncInfo` structs ([#2170](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2170)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust,store] `InputNoteRecord::new` takes a `NoteAttachments` argument; input notes persist attachments (new `attachments` column on `input_notes`) ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `build_wallet_id` dropped its trailing `is_mutable: bool` (code mutability isn't encoded in the account ID) ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][cli] `new-account`/`new-wallet` `--account-type` (`-t`) now accepts only `private`/`public`; legacy faucet/mutability values and `--mutable` are removed. Faucet-vs-regular is derived from packages — a `FungibleFaucet` component yields a fungible faucet with an implicit `TokenPolicyManager` ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `Client::import_notes` returns `Vec<NoteDetailsCommitment>` (was `Vec<NoteId>`), since metadata-less imports have no `NoteId` yet — resolve via `Client::get_input_note_by_commitment` ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203), [#2235](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2235)).
* [BREAKING] Reworked the `GetAccount` surface on `NodeRpcClient`: replaced `get_account_proof` with `get_account(account_id, GetAccountRequest)` and added `resolve_oversize_vault` / `resolve_oversize_storage_maps` helpers. `GetAccountRequest` bundles the previous positional args ([#2202](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2202)).
* [BREAKING][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_note_script_by_root` now returns `Option<NoteScript>` (`None` when the node has no script for the requested root) instead of erroring when the script is absent ([#1840](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1840)).
* [BREAKING] `miden_client::note` re-exports updated to match the protocol's split of attachment data off `NoteMetadata`: removed `NoteAttachmentKind` and `NoteMetadataHeader`, added `NoteAttachmentHeader`, `NoteAttachments`, and `PartialNoteMetadata`. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] `CommittedNoteMetadata` simplified to a single `Full(NoteMetadata)` variant; the `Header { sender, note_type, tag, attachment_kind }` variant is removed because sync responses now always carry full metadata (attachment content is still fetched separately via `GetNotesById`, but is no longer part of `NoteMetadata`). Callers no longer need to handle the header-only case. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_pswap_create` now takes `note_attachment: Option<NoteAttachment>` instead of `NoteAttachment`. Pass `None` when there is nothing to attach (previously `NoteAttachment::default()`). ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] `account list`, `account show`, and `account new-faucet` now read and build the new `FungibleFaucet` component (multi-slot) instead of the standalone `TokenMetadata` storage item. Faucet accounts created with the previous component layout are no longer recognized; new faucets are constructed via `FungibleFaucet::builder` rather than the `basic-fungible-faucet` package. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] Note attachments are no longer carried on the note-transport wire format (only `NoteHeader` + serialized `NoteDetails`). ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING][rust] Removed the top-level `miden_client::standards` alias. Use the curated client paths as before, or the new raw upstream namespaces `miden_client::account::standards::*`, `miden_client::note::standards::*`, and `miden_client::testing::standards::*`. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* Added a blanket implementation for `NodeRpcClient::get_account_details` ([#2196](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2196)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_storage_maps` and `NodeRpcClient::sync_account_vault` now take a required `block_to: BlockNumber` instead of `Option<BlockNumber>`. The node rejects ranges that extend beyond the chain tip, so callers must pass an explicit upper bound (e.g. the client's sync height). ([#2229](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2229))
* Replaced `node-builder` crate with a leaner `test-node-genesis` crate and removed the `testing-remote-prover` crate; the testing node now runs the node's own `miden-remote-prover` ([#2232](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2232)).

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::sync_chain()` (on-chain sync only) and `Client::sync_note_transport()` (Note Transport Layer fetch only) for callers needing finer-grained control over sync. ([#2091](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2091))
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `GrpcClient::with_bearer_auth(token)` to attach an `authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every outbound gRPC call, for use behind authenticating gateways. Tokens are validated at connection time and preserved across `set_genesis_commitment` updates ([#2101](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2101)).
* Made new-account construction use merged storage schema commitment (`build_with_schema_commitment`), re-exported `AccountBuilderSchemaCommitmentExt`, added WASM `buildWithoutSchemaCommitment()`, and fixed contract `accounts.create()` to require explicit `components` ([#1996](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1996)).
* Fixed the faucet token symbol display when showing account details ([#1985](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1985) ([#2158](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2158))).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli,web] Added `get_network_note_status` to `NodeRpcClient` trait for querying the processing status of notes submitted to the network (pending, nullifier-inflight, discarded, nullifier-committed), along with attempt count and error details. Exposed as `miden-client network-note-status <note_id>` CLI command and `RpcClient.getNetworkNoteStatus()` in the web client. ([#1981](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1981))
* Remove MMR peaks from the blocks table and store them alongside the sync height in a new `blockchain_checkpoint` table ([#2100](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2100)).
* Added `miden-cli call` command for invoking account procedures directly from the CLI ([#1943](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1943)).
* [FEATURE][rust,store] Added `BatchBuilder` for stacking multiple transactions against multiple local accounts and submitting them as one proven batch via `SubmitProvenBatch`. Also adds `Store::apply_transaction_batch` (atomic multi-tx apply) with a `SqliteStore` implementation. ([#2109](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2109), [#2160](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2160))
* Made `TransactionStoreUpdate` serialization lossless ([#2112](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2112)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added `address encode <ACCOUNT_ID> <INTERFACE> [TAG_LEN]` subcommand that prints the bech32 encoding of an address built from the given fields (useful for producing the input to `address add`). ([#2115](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2115))
* [FEATURE][cli] On asset display, the CLI now lazily fetches on-chain `TokenMetadata` for untracked public faucets via RPC and persists the result in the client's settings store. ([#2159](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2159))
* [FEATURE][cli] Faucet/account IDs in human-facing CLI output (account list, `notes -s`, transaction summaries) are now rendered as bech32 addresses using the configured network instead of hex IDs. Hex remains in error messages and debug output. ([#2159](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2159))
* Added an integration test for network-transaction public output note creation ([#2073](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2073)).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli] Added DAP-backed transaction execution support through `DapProgramExecutor`/`ProgramExecutor`, and made `miden-client exec --start-debug-adapter` compile source scripts so DAP clients can resolve source locations. ([#2189](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2189), [#2245](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2245))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `StorageView` JS wrapper over WASM `AccountStorage`. `account.storage()` now returns a `StorageView` that makes `getItem()` work intuitively for both Value and StorageMap slots. WASM primitives are unchanged; the raw `AccountStorage` is accessible via `.raw` ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1955)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `wordToBigInt()` utility export for losslessly converting a `Word`'s first felt to a `BigInt`. `StorageResult.toString()` is BigInt-backed, and `valueOf()` returns a JS number for values fitting in `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and throws `RangeError` for larger u64 values — use `.toBigInt()` for exact access ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1955)).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli] Added partial swap (PSWAP) support: `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_pswap_create` / `build_pswap_consume` / `build_pswap_cancel` and a `miden-client pswap` CLI command (`create`, `consume`, `cancel`) for partially-fillable fungible swaps ([#2162](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2162)).
* Added verification of MMR responses during state sync: validated the returned block range matches the requested range and checked that post-delta MMR peaks match the block header's chain commitment ([#1887](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1887)).

## 0.14.9 (2026-05-19)

### Enhancements

* Bumped `miden-vm` workspace dependencies from 0.22.1 to 0.22.4.

## 0.14.7 (2026-06-05)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Added `GrpcClient::with_bearer_auth(token)` to attach an `authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every outbound gRPC call, for use behind authenticating gateways. Tokens are validated at connection time and preserved across `set_genesis_commitment` updates ([#2101](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2101)).

## 0.14.6 (2026-05-05)

### Fixes

* [FIX] When the client submits a network note and it is also tracking the recipient network account, now the `InputNoteReader` detects the consumed note ([#2113](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2113)).
* Changed note transport integration tests to validate note ids and avoid matching with existing notes when running against testnet ([#2148](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2148)).

## 0.14.5 (2026-04-27)

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][behavior][rust,web] `CodeBuilder::compile_note_script` now expects a library module with a single procedure annotated `@note_script` (e.g. `@note_script\npub proc main\n    ...\nend`) instead of a `begin..end` program. Inherited from `miden-standards` 0.14.5, which switched the underlying call from `assemble_program` to `assemble_library` ([#2128](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2128)).

### Enhancements

* Added `ClientBuilder::source_manager()` to override the `SourceManager` used by the client. When not set, the client defaults to `DefaultSourceManager`. Set this when compiling scripts outside the client with an external `Assembler`, so source spans resolve against the same manager ([#2047](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2047)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Stopped the wasm-bindgen-generated array constructors (`NoteArray`, `OutputNoteArray`, `NoteAndArgsArray`, `NoteRecipientArray`, `StorageSlotArray`, `TransactionScriptInputPairArray`, `FeltArray`, `AccountIdArray`, `AccountArray`, `ForeignAccountArray`, `NoteIdAndArgsArray`) from silently moving each input element's underlying Rust value out of the caller's JS handle. The default `pub fn new(elements: Option<Vec<T>>)` path took every element by value via wasm-bindgen's `Vec<T>` ABI: the JS handle's `__wbg_ptr` was left unchanged so the object looked fine, but any subsequent method on it panicked inside WASM with the opaque `"null pointer passed to rust"` error. The auto-generated array exports are now overridden in `js/index.js` with thin wrappers that build the same array via `push(&T)` (which already borrows + clones) so callers can keep using the originals after construction. Same pattern applied to `replaceAt` on the Rust side, which now takes `elem: &T` instead of `elem: T`. Repro: `const note = new Note(...); new NoteArray([note]); note.id();` — used to panic, now succeeds.
* [FIX][rust] Fixed source manager mismatch panic (`invalid source span: starting byte is out of bounds`) in tests that compiled scripts with a standalone `SourceManager` and then executed them through the client. Test helpers now use `TransactionKernel::assembler_with_source_manager()` and the client's shared source manager ([#2047](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2047)).
* [FIX][react] Fixed `initializeSignerAccount` (the external-keystore init path used by `MidenFiSignerProvider`, Para, Turnkey, etc.) throwing `"invalid enum value passed"` on first connect. The code reached for `AuthScheme.AuthEcdsaK256Keccak`, which only exists on the internal wasm-bindgen `AuthScheme` enum, not on the public string-valued `AuthScheme` constant exported from `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/lazy` — at runtime it resolved to `undefined`, and passing `undefined` to `AccountComponent.createAuthComponentFromCommitment` failed at the wasm boundary. `initializeSignerAccount` now calls `resolveAuthScheme(AuthScheme.ECDSA)`, where `resolveAuthScheme` is a newly-public helper from `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` that converts the string constants to the numeric wasm-bindgen variant.
* [FIX][react] `DEFAULTS.AUTH_SCHEME` was being initialized to `AuthScheme.AuthRpoFalcon512` — another nonexistent key on the public `AuthScheme`, silently resolving to `undefined`. Now set to `AuthScheme.Falcon`. The four hooks that read this default (`useCreateWallet`, `useCreateFaucet`, `useImportAccount`, `useSessionAccount`) now pipe the value through `resolveAuthScheme(...)` before handing it to the wasm-bindgen `newWallet` / `newFaucet` / `importPublicAccountFromSeed` calls. The public hook option types stay `authScheme?: AuthScheme`, which now correctly means `"falcon" | "ecdsa"`.

## 0.14.4 (2026-04-20)

### Features

* Added DAP-backed transaction script debugging support with `--start-debug-adapter` flag on the `exec` CLI command, `execute_program_with_dap` client method, and offline bootstrap mode for node-less execution ([#1959](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1959)).
* [FEATURE][web] Serialize all async `WebClient` JS methods — both the explicit wrappers and every async call that falls through `createClientProxy` to the underlying WASM client (e.g. `getAccount`, `importAccountById`, `getAccountStorage`) — via an internal `_serializeWasmCall` chain. Prevents `"recursive use of an object detected"` panics when an unwrapped read/write races the auto-sync timer or any explicitly-wrapped method. Expose `waitForIdle()` on `MidenClient` so callers can drain in-flight work before mutating non-WASM state ([#2057](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2057)).
* [FEATURE][web] Split `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` into eager and lazy entry points. The default entry (`import from "@miden-sdk/miden-sdk"`) now awaits WASM at module top level via a small shim (`js/eager.js`) — consumers don't need `await MidenClient.ready()` / `isReady` before constructing wasm-bindgen types. The lazy entry (`import from "@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/lazy"`) preserves the previous behavior and is required for Capacitor WKWebView hosts (the custom-scheme handler hangs on TLA) and Next.js SSR. Verified empirically against the Miden Wallet's iOS E2E suite on devnet. `@miden-sdk/react` imports from `/lazy` internally and manages readiness via `isReady`.
* [FEATURE][web] Expose `lastAuthError()` on `MidenClient` for typed sign-callback failure recovery — preserves the raw thrown value from the JS signCallback so consumers can distinguish locked/rejected/IO-error failure modes ([#2058](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2058)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `"custom"` operation to `preview()` so users can dry-run any pre-built `TransactionRequest`, not just send/mint/consume/swap ([#2052](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2052)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `BlockHeader.nativeAssetId()` so JavaScript consumers can read the native fungible-faucet account ID from a block header. The field already rides the RPC wire and is decoded into the Rust `BlockHeader`, but no WASM accessor existed, forcing wallets and dApps to hardcode the native faucet per network ([#2070](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2070)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] `proveTransactionWithProver` now takes `&TransactionProver` by reference instead of consuming by value — the old signature invalidated the JS handle after one use, silently falling back to local proving on subsequent calls ([#2062](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2062)).

## 0.14.3 (2026-04-16)

### Fixes

* [FIX] Detect notes created and consumed on the same block that got erased from the node and mark them as consumed ([#2008](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2008)).

## 0.14.2 (2026-04-15)

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] Added `compile.noteScript({ code, libraries? })` to `MidenClient`, filling the gap left on the resource-based surface for note-script compilation. Mirrors the existing `compile.txScript` shape ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2044)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exported the `CompilerResource` class so framework wrappers (e.g. React hooks) can instantiate the compile surface over a `WasmWebClient` proxy without wrapping the full `MidenClient`. The third constructor argument is now optional ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2044)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` deterministically failing with `mmr peaks are invalid: number of one bits in leaves is N which does not equal peak length M` after importing a private note whose inclusion block pre-dates the wallet's current sync height. `get_and_store_authenticated_block` was overwriting the correct historical peaks (written by `applyStateSync`) with peaks from the caller's current `PartialMmr` forest, so subsequent reads at the same block hit the `InvalidPeaks` validation. The IndexedDB `insertBlockHeader` now uses add-if-not-exists semantics, matching the SQLite store's `INSERT OR IGNORE` in `insert_block_header_tx` ([#2039](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2039)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed WASM worker loading under webpack 5 / Next.js consumers. v0.14.1's single classic worker rewrote `import.meta.url` → `self.location.href` (needed for Safari/WKWebView cold-start performance), which webpack's asset tracer cannot follow — consumers hit a 404 on `miden_client_web.wasm` and the SDK silently fell back to a main-thread mode that hung on `sync()`. The SDK now ships BOTH variants (`web-client-methods-worker.js` classic for Safari, `web-client-methods-worker.module.js` ES module for webpack/Vite/Parcel) and `WebClient` picks at runtime via UA detection, configurable via the new `WebClient.workerMode` (`"auto"` / `"module"` / `"classic"`) static. No consumer config changes needed for auto ([#2046](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2046)).

## 0.14.1 (2026-04-14)

### Enhancements

* Optimized `get_account_details` so it only fetches the delta of large public accounts when syncing ([#1916](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1916)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` failure ("inconsistent partial mmr: tracked leaf at position N has no value in nodes") caused by skipping authentication node collection for blocks already tracked from the MMR delta during large catch-up syncs. Authentication nodes are now always collected for note-relevant blocks regardless of prior tracking state. ([#1997](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1997)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `transactions.send({ returnNote: true })` throwing `expected instance of NoteArray`. The JS wrapper was still building `OutputNoteArray` after the WASM binding for `withOwnOutputNotes` switched to `NoteArray` ([#2011](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2011)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed `FilesystemKeyStore::add_key` failing on Linux when the system temp dir is on a different filesystem than the keys directory ([#2009](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2009)).
* [FIX][rust] Made source manager handling consistent when building transaction scripts. The empty fallback script is now compiled against the client's source manager instead of a fresh one, so any source information on the produced `TransactionScript` is registered with the same source manager used by the executor ([#2006](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2006)).

## 0.14.0 (2026-04-07)

### Enhancements

* Made `GrpcNoteTransportClient` connection lazy, deferring it to the first RPC call instead of connecting eagerly at client initialization ([#1970](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1970)).
* Updated the `GrpcClient` to fetch the RPC limits from the node ([#1724](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1724)) ([#1737](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1737), [#1809](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1809)).
* Added typed error parsing for node RPC endpoints, enabling programmatic error handling instead of string parsing ([#1734](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1734)).
* Added `--rpc-status` flag to `miden-client info` command to display RPC node status information including node version, genesis commitment, store status, and block producer status; also added `get_status_unversioned` to `NodeRpcClient` trait ([#1742](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1742)).
* Prevent a potential unwrap panic in `insert_storage_map_nodes_for_map` ([#1750](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1750)).
* Changed the `StateSync::sync_state()` to take a reference of the MMR ([#1764](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1764)).
* Account storage restructured into latest/historical tables for efficient delta writes and simpler pruning ([#1775](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1775)).
* Remove unnecessary clones of `NoteInclusionProof` and `NoteMetadata` in note import and sync paths ([#1787](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1787)).
* [FEATURE][web] WebClient now automatically syncs state before account creation when the client has never been synced, preventing a slow full-chain scan on the next sync (#1704).
* Added `NoteScreener` constructor via `Client::note_screener()` and improved note consumability checks with batch note screening support ([#1803](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1803), [#1814](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1814)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `getAccountProof` method to the web client's `RpcClient`, allowing lightweight retrieval of account header, storage slot values, and code via a single RPC call. Refactored the `NodeRpcClient::get_account_proof` signature to allow requesting just private account proofs ([#1794](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1794), [#1814](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1814)).
* Added `getAccountByKeyCommitment` method to `WebClient` for retrieving accounts by public key commitment ([#1729](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1729)).
* [BREAKING][removal][web] Removed `addAccountSecretKeyToWebStore`, `getAccountAuthByPubKeyCommitment`, `getPublicKeyCommitmentsOfAccount`, and `getAccountByKeyCommitment` from `WebClient`. Use the new `client.keystore` sub-object instead (e.g. `client.keystore.insert()`, `client.keystore.get()`, `client.keystore.getCommitments()`, `client.keystore.getAccountId()` + `client.getAccount()`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1947)).
* Added automatic registration of note scripts required by network transactions (NTX): the client checks the node's script registry before submitting and registers any missing scripts. Standard note scripts are skipped since the NTX builder resolves them directly ([#1840](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1840)).
* Added automatic retry for rate-limited (`ResourceExhausted`) and transiently unavailable RPC calls in `GrpcClient`, with up to 5 attempts and `retry-after` header support ([#1928](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1928)).
* Added client methods to prune account history (commitments of previous nonces, alongside its orphaned account code) ([#1886](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1886)).
* Changed the sync state to track the consumer account on externally-consumed notes, so the `InputNoteReader` can return notes even if the transaction was not locally executed ([#1973](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1973)).

### Changes

* [BREAKING] Incremented MSRV to 1.91 ([#1798](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1798)).
* [BREAKING] Replaced `AuthFalcon512Rpo`/`AuthEcdsaK256Keccak` with unified  `AuthSingleSig`, changed `StorageMapKey` from a type alias to a newtype, renamed note constructors to associated methods (`P2idNote::create`, `SwapNote::create`, `P2ideNote::create`), and started requiring `AccountComponentMetadata` in `AccountComponent::new`([#1798](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1798)).
* Included Partial states in `NoteFilter::Unspent` for output notes ([#1817](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1817)).
* [BREAKING][arch][web] Replaced the `WebClient` class with a new `MidenClient` resource-based API as the primary web SDK entry point. `WebClient` is still available as `WasmWebClient` for low-level access but is no longer part of the public API. All documentation has been updated to use `MidenClient`. Migration: replace `WebClient.createClient(rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName)` with `MidenClient.create({ rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName })`, and replace direct method calls (e.g. `client.newWallet(...)`, `client.submitNewTransaction(...)`, `client.getAccounts()`) with resource methods (e.g. `client.accounts.create()`, `client.transactions.send(...)`, `client.accounts.list()`). ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AccountId.fromHex()` now returns `Result` (throws on invalid hex) instead of silently panicking via `unwrap()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING] Added a `AccountReader` accessible through `Client::account_reader` to read account data without needing to load the whole `Account` ([#1713](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1713), [#1716](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1716)).
* [BREAKING] Added `Keystore` trait that extends `TransactionAuthenticator` to provide a unified interface for key storage, retrieval, and account-key mapping, enabling custom keystore implementations. `Keystore` replaces `TransactionAuthenticator` in `Client` and provides a way to map from account IDs to public keys (registering them separately is not required anymore). ([#1726](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1726)).
* Refactored integration tests binary with subprocess-per-test execution; added automatic retry of failed tests (`--retry-count`), captured stdout/stderr per test, and tracing support via `RUST_LOG` ([#1743](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1743)).
* Improved integration test logging with a `--verbose` flag for info-level tracing, routed tracing output to stderr to avoid corrupting subprocess JSON, and added `tracing::info!` instrumentation to test helpers ([#1816](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1816)).
* Added implementation for the `get_public_key` method on the `FilesystemKeystore` and `WebKeystore` ([#1731](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1731)).
* [BREAKING] Made the nullifiers sync optional on the `StateSync` component ([#1756](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1756)).
* Decoupled keystore functionality from `WebStore` by moving keystore helper logic from `idxdb-store` into the `web-client` crate, also added `export_store` and `import_store` methods to the `Store` trait, enabling usage of different stores ([#1795](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1795)).
* [BREAKING] Added `SyncStateInputs` to bundle the parameters needed to perform the sync state ([#1778](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1778)).
* Added lazy loading for foreign accounts. Specifying `TransactionRequestBuilder::foreign_accounts()` for public accounts is no longer required ([#1812](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1812), [#1892](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1892)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AuthSecretKey.getRpoFalcon512SecretKeyAsFelts()` and `getEcdsaK256KeccakSecretKeyAsFelts()` now return `Result<Vec<Felt>, JsValue>` instead of panicking on key type mismatch ([#1833](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1833)).
* [BREAKING][rename][cli] Renamed `CliConfig::from_system()` to `CliConfig::load()` and `CliClient::from_system_user_config()` to `CliClient::new()` for better discoverability ([#1848](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1848)).
* Removed `SmtForest` empty-root workaround in `AccountSmtForest::safe_pop_smts`, now that the upstream fix has landed in miden-crypto v0.19.7 ([#1864](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1864)).
* [BREAKING][rename][all] Adapted to upstream protocol renames: `Falcon512Rpo` renamed to `Falcon512Poseidon2`, `Felt::as_int()` renamed to `as_canonical_u64()`, `OutputNote::Full` replaced by `OutputNote::Public(PublicOutputNote)`, Asset now uses key-value words API.
* [BREAKING][rename][all] Adapted to upstream protocol 0.14.0 renames: `NoteHeader::commitment()` renamed to `to_commitment()`, `NoteLocation::node_index_in_block()` renamed to `block_note_tree_index()`, `StorageMapKey::inner()` removed (use `Word::from(key)`), `TransactionOutputs::expiration_block_num` field now private (use getter). ([#1926](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1926))
* Added an `InputNoteReader` accessible through `client.input_note_reader()` that allows for lazy iterator over all the consumed input notes ([#1843](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1843), ([#1925](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1925))).
* Removed miden-cli template TOMLs in favor of direct serialization into packages ([#1879](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1879)).
* [BREAKING] Updated `SyncState` to fetch multiple note updates ([#1941](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1941), [#1963](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1963)).
* Unified test environment variables across Rust and web client test suites. `TEST_MIDEN_NETWORK` now acts as a preset that configures all components (RPC, prover, note transport) for `devnet`/`testnet`/`localhost`. Individual env vars (`TEST_MIDEN_RPC_URL`, `TEST_MIDEN_PROVER_URL`, `TEST_MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_URL`) override specific components. Removed `TEST_MIDEN_RPC_ENDPOINT`, `TEST_WITH_NOTE_TRANSPORT`, `TEST_MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT`, and `REMOTE_PROVER` ([#1939](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1939)).
* [BREAKING] Updated miden-node crates to v0.14.3 and adapted to upstream package-related changes: `MastArtifact` and `PackageKind` removed, `Package::mast` is now `Arc<Library>`, `PackageManifest::new()` returns `Result`, `assemble_library()` returns `Arc<Library>`([#1972](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1972)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] New `MidenClient` class with resource-based API (`client.accounts`, `client.transactions`, `client.notes`, `client.tags`, `client.settings`). Provides high-level transaction helpers (`send`, `mint`, `consume`, `swap`, `consumeAll`), transaction dry-runs via `preview()`, confirmation polling via `waitFor()`, and flexible account/note references that accept hex strings, bech32 strings, or WASM objects interchangeably (`AccountRef`, `NoteInput` types). Factory methods: `MidenClient.create()`, `MidenClient.createTestnet()`, `MidenClient.createMock()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionId.fromHex()` static constructor for creating transaction IDs from hex strings. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added standalone tree-shakeable note utilities (`createP2IDNote`, `createP2IDENote`, `buildSwapTag`) usable without a client instance. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] SDK ergonomics: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, `accounts.import()` accepts full `AccountRef`, `transactions.send()` return type changed to `SendResult` with optional `returnNote`, notes API simplified (`listAvailable` returns `InputNoteRecord[]`, `consume` accepts `Note` objects), `MidenClient.create()` accepts rpcUrl/proverUrl shorthands.
* [BREAKING][FEATURE][web] Custom contract support: `accounts.create()` with `ImmutableContract`/`MutableContract` types, new `client.compile` resource (`compile.component()`, `compile.txScript()` with `"dynamic"`/`"static"` linking), and `transactions.execute({ account, script, foreignAccounts? })` for custom script execution with FPI. `transactions.send()` return type changed. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Account import improvements: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, and `accounts.import()` now accepts full `AccountRef` (string, `AccountId`, `Account`, `AccountHeader`) in addition to `{ file }` and `{ seed }` forms. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `AccountId.fromPrefixSuffix(prefix, suffix)` constructor for building an `AccountId` from its two felt components, useful when prefix/suffix are stored separately in storage maps. ([#1889](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1889))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionRequestBuilder.withExpirationDelta()` for expiring manual transaction requests ([#1904](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1904))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `accounts.insert({ account, overwrite? })` to `MidenClient` for inserting pre-built `Account` objects into the local store. Enables external signer integrations that build accounts via `AccountBuilder` with custom auth commitments ([#1922](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1922)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `executeProgram` (view call) to the JS side, allowing local execution of a transaction script against an account and inspection of the 16-element stack output without submitting to the network. Added `AdviceInputs` constructor and reverse `From` conversions. ([#1859](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1859))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `client.keystore` sub-object API for managing secret keys. Methods: `insert(accountId, secretKey)`, `get(pubKeyCommitment)`, `remove(pubKeyCommitment)`, `getCommitments(accountId)`, `getAccountId(pubKeyCommitment)`. Also available on `MidenClient` as a resource (`client.keystore`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1947))

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Replaced `.unwrap()` panics with proper `Result` returns in `MerklePath.computeRoot()`, `NoteExecutionHint.fromParts()`, `NoteExecutionHint.canBeConsumed()`, `NoteStorage` constructor, and `TransactionStatus.discarded()` WASM bindings ([#1870](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1870)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed `get_vault_asset_witnesses` failing with `MerkleError::RootNotInStore` when the vault root is missing from the `AccountSmtForest`. The error is now caught and falls back to loading the full vault from the store ([#1890](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1890)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed the error `TypeError: parameter 1 is not of type 'ArrayBuffer'` when re-initializing a client with an imported database. `Uint8Array` fields (e.g. the client version setting) were exported as plain arrays and not restored to `Uint8Array` on import, causing `TextDecoder.decode()` to fail. Export now tags `Uint8Array` values for correct round-trip. ([#1952](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1952))
* [FIX][rust] Replaced `.expect()` panics on RPC response data with proper error propagation ([#1833](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1833)).

## 0.13.4 (2026-03-23)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed storage map slots with duplicate roots losing their entries after a store round-trip, which corrupted the storage commitment ([#1915](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1915)).
* [FIX][all] Fixed private notes delivered via NTL getting stuck as `Expected` when syncing at high frequency (e.g. every 3s). The on-chain commitment could be processed before the NTL delivered the note data, causing the note to never transition to `Committed`. The note import flow now scans back up to 20 blocks from the current sync height when checking for committed notes, so notes committed just before the client synced past them are found during import.

## 0.13.3 (2026-03-16)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed `sync_state()` invoking the external signer (e.g. wallet extension) during note consumability checks, causing repeated confirmation popups on every sync cycle. `NoteScreener` no longer attaches the `TransactionAuthenticator` when trial-executing consume transactions; accounts requiring auth now return `ConsumableWithAuthorization` instead ([#1905](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1905)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed redundant `/GetAccount` RPC calls during `sync_state()` — a public account active across N sync steps now triggers exactly 1 fetch instead of N ([#1876](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1876)).
* [FIX] Deduplicated storage map entries returned by the `SyncAccountStorageMaps` RPC endpoint, keeping only the latest value per key. Previously, accounts with storage map keys updated across multiple blocks would fail to load ([#1902](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1902)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `PrematureCommitError` crash during `syncState()` by moving all IndexedDB writes into a single Dexie transaction instead of spawning competing inner transactions ([#1876](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1876)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `getAccountProof` in the `RpcClient`, accepting optional `AccountStorageRequirements` and block number parameters to fetch specific storage maps without full account reconstruction ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1917)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `syncStorageMaps` in the `RpcClient` for paginated retrieval of large storage maps ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1917)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `storage_details()` and `find_map_details()` accessors to `AccountProof` for direct access to storage map data ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1917)).

## 0.13.2 (2026-02-26)

* Updated to `miden-crypto` v0.19.5 ([#1813](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1813)).
* [FIX] Stopped including unnecessary storage map data when loading existing accounts for transaction execution. New accounts (nonce == 0) still get full storage maps as needed for kernel validation ([#1832](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1832)).
* [FIX][web] Added missing `attachment()` getter to `NoteMetadata` WASM binding ([#1810](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1810)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed transaction execution failures after reopening a browser extension by always persisting MMR authentication nodes during sync, even for blocks with no relevant notes. Previously, closing and reopening the extension lost in-memory MMR state and the store was missing nodes needed for Merkle authentication paths. Also surfaces a distinct `PartialBlockchainNodeNotFound` error instead of a confusing deserialization crash when nodes are missing ([#1789](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1789)).

## 0.13.1 (2026-02-13)

* Added the `@miden-sdk/react` hooks library (see [its own changelog](packages/react-sdk/CHANGELOG.md)) ([#1711](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1711)).
* Fixed WASM bindings consuming JS objects: `RpcClient` and `WebClient` methods now take references (`&AccountId`, `&Word`) instead of owned values, so callers can reuse objects after passing them ([#1765](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1765)).
* Fixed `AccountSmtForest` pruning shared SMT roots between old and new account states, which caused `MerkleError::RootNotInStore` during note screening after `sync_state()` ([#1771](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1771)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `setupLogging(level)` and `logLevel` parameter on `createClient` to route Rust tracing output to the browser console with configurable verbosity ([#1669](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1669)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added 3-layer concurrency safety for WASM access: in-tab async lock, cross-tab IndexedDB lock, and auto-sync on cross-tab state changes ([#1784](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1784)).

## 0.13.0 (2026-01-28)

* [BREAKING] Removed `getRpoFalcon512PublicKeyAsWord` and `getEcdsaK256KeccakPublicKeyAsWord` in `AuthSecretKey`
* Improved auth scheme handling across the Rust and web clients (typed `build_wallet_id`, unified transaction tests, new shared `getPublicKeyAsWord` binding, and refreshed typedoc output) ([#1556](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1556)).
* [BREAKING] Typed the `auth_scheme` plumbing across the Rust WebClient ID-building helpers and aligned the WebClient bindings with the native enum to avoid passing raw identifiers ([#1546](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1546)).
* [BREAKING] WebClient `AccountComponent.createAuthComponentFromCommitment` now takes `AuthScheme` (enum) instead of a numeric scheme id. The old `AccountComponent.createAuthComponent` method was removed; use `createAuthComponentFromSecretKey` instead ([#1578](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1578)).
* Changed `blockNum` type from `string` to `number` in WebClient transaction interfaces for better type safety and consistency ([#1528](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1528)).
* Consolidated `FetchedNote` fields into `NoteHeader` ([#1536](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1536)).
* Tied the web client's IndexedDB schema to the running package version, automatically recreating or wiping stale stores and applying the same guard to `forceImportStore` ([#1576](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1576)).
* Added the `--remote-prover-timeout` configuration to the CLI ([#1551](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1551)).
* Surface WASM worker errors to the JS wrapper with their original stacks for clearer diagnostics ([#1565](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1565)).

* Added pagination handling for `sync_storage_maps` and `sync_account_vault` RPC endpoints.
* Added a convenience function `fromBech32` to turn a bech32 string into an AccountId ([#1607](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1607)).
* [BREAKING] Refactored the fields in retrieved notes in the WebClient: now the inclusion proof has been factored out and is always accessible ([#1606](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1606)).
* [BREAKING] Renamed `NodeRpcClient::get_account_proofs` to `NodeRpcClient::get_account_proof` & added `account_state` parameter (block at which we want to retrieve the proof) ([#1616](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1616)).
* [BREAKING] Refactored `NetworkId` to allow custom networks ([#1612](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1612)).
* [BREAKING] Removed `toBech32Custom` and implemented custom id conversion for wasm derived class `NetworkId` ([#1612](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1612)).
* [BREAKING] Remove `SecretKey` model and consolidated functionality into `AuthSecretKey` ([#1592](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1380))
* Incremented the limits for various RPC calls to accommodate larger data sets ([#1621](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1621)).
* [BREAKING] Introduced named storage slots, changed `FilesystemKeystore` to not be generic over RNG ([#1626](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1626)).
* Added `submit_new_transaction_with_prover` to the Rust client and `submitNewTransactionWithProver` to the WebClient([#1622](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1622)).
* Fixed MMR reconstruction code and fixed how block authentication paths are adjusted ([#1633](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1633)).
* Added WebClient bindings and RPC helpers for additional account, note, and validation workflows ([#1638](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1638)).
* [BREAKING] Modified JS binding for `AccountComponent::compile` which now takes an `AccountComponentCode` built with the newly added binding `CodeBuilder::compile_account_component_code` ([#1627](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1627)).
* Expanded the `GrpcClient` API with methods to fetch account proofs and rebuild the slots for an account ([#1591](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1591)).
* [BREAKING] `WebClient.addAccountSecretKeyToWebStore` now takes an additional parameter: an account ID. This will link the ID with the secret key in the WebStore. Added `WebClient.getPublicKeyCommitmentsOfAccount` method that will return a list of related public key commitments for the given account ID ([#1608](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1608)).
* [BREAKING] Added naming to `IndexedDB` store to allow multiple WebClient instances to run in the same browser; `WebClient.createClient` now takes an optional DB name (otherwise defaults to name based on the endpoint/network) ([#1645](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1645)).
* [BREAKING] Simplified the `NoteScreener` API, removing `NoteRelevance` in favor of `NoteConsumptionStatus`; exposed JS bindings for consumption check results ([#1630](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1630)).
* [BREAKING] Replaced `TransactionRequestBuilder::unauthenticated_input_notes` & `TransactionRequestBuilder::authenticated_input_notes` for `TransactionRequestBuilder::input_notes`, now the user passes a list of notes which the `Client` itself determines the authentication status of ([#1624](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1624)).
* Updated `SqliteStore`: replaced `MerkleStore` with `SmtForest` and introduced `AccountSmtForest`; simplified queries ([#1526](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1526), [#1663](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1663)).
* Added filter to store query to improve how the MMR is built ([#1681](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1681)).
* [BREAKING] Required the client RNG to be `Send + Sync` (via the `ClientFeltRng` marker and `ClientRngBox` alias) so `Client` can be `Send + Sync` ([#1677](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1677)).
* [BREAKING] Refactored `FilesystemKeyStore` to implement the new `Keystore` trait, enabling custom keystore implementations ([#1726](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1726)).
* Fixed a race condition in `pruneIrrelevantBlocks` that could delete the current block header when multiple tabs share IndexedDB, causing sync to panic ([#1650](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1650)).
* Fixed a race condition where concurrent sync operations could cause sync height to go backwards, leading to block header deletion and subsequent panics ([#1650](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1650)).
* Changed `get_current_partial_mmr` to return a `StoreError::BlockHeaderNotFound` error instead of panicking when the block header is missing ([#1650](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1650)).
* Added `CliClient` wrapper and `CliConfig::from_system()` to allow creating a CLI-configured client programmatically ([#1642](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1642)).
* [BREAKING] Updated `BlockNumber` IndexedDB type: changed from `string` to `number` ([#1684](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1684)).

* Added sync lock to coordinate concurrent `syncState()` calls in the WebClient using the Web Locks API, with coalescing behavior where concurrent callers share results from an in-progress sync ([#1690](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1690)).
* [BREAKING] Removed the `payback_note_type` field from the swap command ([#1700](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1700)).
* Added `miden-bench` tool to benchmark client operations ([#1721](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1721)).

## 0.12.6 (2026-01-08)

* Enabled Workers with `createClientWithExternalKeystore` via callbacks ([#1569](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1569)).
* Added `executeForSummary` method to WebClient that executes a transaction and returns a `TransactionSummary`, handling both authorized and unauthorized transactions ([#1620](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1620)).
* Added WebClient bindings for the RPO Falcon512 multisig auth component ([#1620](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1620)).
* Added seed to `AccountStatus::Locked` variant in `AccountRecord` to track private accounts that are locked due to a mismatch in the account commitment ([#1665](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1665)).

## 0.12.5 (2025-12-01)

* Removed the top-level await from the web-client JS entry point by lazily loading the WASM module, allowing `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` to be imported normally (including in Next.js SSR builds), and updated the worker bootstrap to match.
* Changed the default note transport endpoint from `localhost` to `https://transport.miden.io` ([#1574](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1574)).
