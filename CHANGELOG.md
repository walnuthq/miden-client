# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][removal][rust] Removed `miden_client::rng::{draw_felt, draw_word}` helpers, `Felt` or `Word` can be generated with `rng.random::<Felt>()` and `rng.random::<Word>()` (via `rand::RngExt`) ([#2665](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2665)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added `TransactionFilter::Query`, which takes a `TransactionFilterQuery` to select transactions by account and status, newest first, up to a limit. `TransactionFilter` is now `#[non_exhaustive]` ([#2589](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2589)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][cli] Added `tx --show <ID>`, which prints the transaction record and its input and output notes with their standard note name, store state and decoded P2ID, P2IDE, SWAP or PSWAP storage. Added `--account-id`, `--status` and `--limit` filters to `tx --list`, which now orders transactions by creation time ([#2589](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2589)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Extended `notes --show <ID>` to print whether the note is an input or an output note, the consuming transaction and account of an input note, and the note attachments, with the fields of network account target and PSWAP attachments. The storage of a P2ID, P2IDE, SWAP, PSWAP or FEE_SPONSORSHIP note is shown as named fields instead of raw storage items. `notes --show` and `tx --show` show every storage field of these notes, including the P2IDE reclaimer and the SWAP payback tag and payback target or recipient. For other notes, `tx --show` shows the raw storage items instead of `-` ([#2636](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2636)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added the `SendNotesTransactionScript` re-export to `miden_client::transaction` ([#2589](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2589)).
* [FEATURE][cli] The CLI caches faucet metadata lookups for the lifetime of a command, so several assets from the same faucet cause at most one metadata RPC fetch. The cache also holds misses ([#2589](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2589)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][rust] `IdPrefixFetchError::NoMatch` names the kind of entry that was looked up, instead of always saying "notes" ([#2589](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2589)).

## 0.17.0 (2026-10-02)

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][removal][rust] Removed the `miden_client::crypto::RandomCoin` re-export. Use a `rand` CSPRNG such as `ChaCha20Rng`, plus the new `miden_client::rng::{draw_felt, draw_word}` helpers where a `Felt` or `Word` is needed from a generator that does not implement `FeltRng` ([#2414](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2414)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `ClientBuilder::rng` is now only available under the `testing` feature and requires `CryptoRng + Send + Sync`; the marker trait `ClientFeltRng` is renamed to `ClientCryptoRng`. Outside of tests the client's RNG is always an OS-seeded `ChaCha20Rng`; drop the `rng()` call ([#2414](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2414)).
* [BREAKING][arch][rust,store] Updated protocol dependencies to `0.17.0`, Miden VM to `0.35`, `miden-debug` to `0.18.0` and `miden-node-proto-build` to `0.17.0-rc.4`. Requires a compatible node and a new client database ([#2530](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2530), [#2549](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2549), [#2562](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2562), [#2594](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2594), [#2621](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2621), [#2651](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2651)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] `Keystore::get_account_key_commitments` returns an empty set for an account the keystore holds no key for, instead of an error. An account can use keys that are held elsewhere, so this is a valid state. Code that read the error as "this account is unknown" must check for an empty set instead. `export --account` now exports such an account instead of failing with "No keys found for account" ([#2556](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2556)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `StoreError::DatabaseTransientError` and `StoreError::DatabasePermanentError` variants, so exhaustive matches on `StoreError` must handle them. The SQLite store returns the first for a busy or locked database and the second for a constraint violation or a corrupt database file, which it previously reported as `StoreError::DatabaseError` ([#2537](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2537)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Flattened `SyncedNote`, it now carries `note_id`, `metadata` and `inclusion_proof` directly, replacing the nested `committed: CommittedNote` field. Code that read that field can call `SyncedNote::into_committed_note` to get the sync record back, with the note's resolved attachments included ([#2475](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2475)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NoteObserver::observe` now takes a single `&SyncedNote` instead of a `&CommittedNote` and its `&NoteAttachments` ([#2475](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2475)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] Notes fetched from the Note Transport Layer are screened when their tag matches a tracked account's tag, discarding the ones no tracked account can consume ([#2474](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2474)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] A Note Transport Layer failure no longer fails `Client::sync_state`. The error is logged and the chain sync still applies; the transport cursor is left where it was, so the next sync requests the same page again ([#2453](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2453)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `TransactionRequestError::SwapNoteWithZeroAsset` variant, so exhaustive matches on `TransactionRequestError` must handle it ([#2459](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2459)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] Removed `TransactionFilter::to_query`. The method emitted `SQLite` text from the storage-agnostic `Store` module, so the query now lives in `miden-client-sqlite-store` next to the `NoteFilter` queries.
* [BREAKING][removal][test] Loose helper functions in `miden_client::testing::common` are now methods on `TestClient`. `TestClient::keystore()` exposes the client's keystore, so `ClientConfig::into_client` and `into_unsynced_client` return just the `TestClient` instead of a client/keystore pair ([#2481](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2481)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] `tokens_to_base_units`, `base_units_to_tokens` and `TokenParseError` are removed from `miden_client::utils`. They format and parse fungible amounts for display against a faucet's decimals, which only the CLI needs, so they now live in the CLI crate ([#2515](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2515)).
* [BREAKING][arch][rust,rpc] Protocol object messages now come from the canonical `miden-objects` schemas instead of node-owned copies: `proto::account`, `proto::asset`, `proto::blockchain`, `proto::note`, `proto::primitives`, `proto::protocol_config` and `proto::transaction` are now re-exports of `miden_objects::proto`, and `primitives.Digest` is now `primitives.Word`. The RPC domain conversions decode a message and then build or verify it, following the `miden-objects` split. Requires a node that speaks the canonical schemas ([#2549](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2549)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust,rpc] Removed the protobuf conversions for protocol objects from the client: the `rpc::domain` modules `block`, `digest`, `merkle` and `smt` are gone, along with the `AccountId`, `AccountHeader`, `AccountStorageHeader`, `AccountWitness`, `NoteId`, `NoteMetadata`, `NoteHeader`, `NoteInclusionProof`, `NoteScript`, `TransactionId` and `Asset` conversions in the surviving modules ([#2549](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2549)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `RpcConversionError` gained a `CanonicalConversion` variant that wraps `miden_objects::ConversionError`, and lost the `DeserializationError`, `NotAValidFelt`, `NoteTypeError`, `MerkleError` and `InvalidInt` variants, which the removed conversions were the only source of. `ConversionError` is re-exported from `rpc`, so matching on the variant that wraps it needs no direct `miden-objects` dependency ([#2549](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2549)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `TryFrom<proto::Proof> for ProvenTransaction` now reports `TransactionProverError` instead of `DeserializationError`, keeping the original error as its source ([#2549](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2549)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] The re-exported `NoteExecutionHint` gained an `Unknown(Felt)` variant, so exhaustive matches on it must handle the new variant. `NoteExecutionHint::into_parts` now returns `Option<(u8, u32)>`, which is `None` for `Unknown`, and the `TryFrom<u64>` and `From<NoteExecutionHint> for u64` conversions are replaced by `From<Felt>` and `From<NoteExecutionHint> for Felt`. An unrecognized encoding is now preserved as `Unknown` instead of being rejected ([#2549](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2549)).
* [BREAKING][rename][rust] Renamed the `ClientError::TransactionScriptError` and `StoreError::TransactionScriptError` variants to `MastForestScriptError`, matching the upstream type that now backs both note scripts and transaction scripts ([#2530](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2530)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] `AccountReader::get_balance` now returns an error instead of `AssetAmount::ZERO` when the stored asset cannot be read as a fungible asset. A missing asset still reports a zero balance ([#2530](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2530)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_block_by_number` returns a `SignedBlock` and an optional `ExecutionProof` instead of a `ProvenBlock`. The node carries the block and its proof in separate response fields. The proof is `None` when it is not requested, and also when the node has not proven the block yet ([#2530](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2530)).
* [BREAKING][rename][rust] Replaced the `ValidatorKeys` re-export with `ValidatorConfig` and `ProvingOptions` with `Prover` ([#2530](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2530)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] Removed the upstream `FungibleAssetDelta`, `NonFungibleAssetDelta`, `NonFungibleDeltaAction`, and `SmtForest` re-exports ([#2530](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2530)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `TransactionRequest::incoming_assets` now returns `Vec<Asset>` for assets without fungible amounts ([#2530](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2530)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] The note transport gRPC client now uses the service and message definitions from the node repository, through `miden-node-proto-build` from crates.io. `NoteTransportCursor` now stores the node's nonce and sequence, and the unsupported `NoteTransportClient::stream_notes` API and `NoteStream` trait were removed ([#2594](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2594)).
* [BREAKING][arch][rust] `AccountFile` and `NoteFile` moved from `miden-protocol` and `miden-standards` to `miden-objects`. Both are re-exported from `miden_client::account` and `miden_client::note` as before ([#2594](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2594)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `AccountFile` and `NoteFile` are encoded as Protobuf, so files written by earlier versions no longer decode. `Deserializable::read_from_bytes` is replaced by `try_from_bytes`, which reports the new `AccountFileError` and `NoteFileError` ([#2594](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2594)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] The `AccountFile` fields `account` and `auth_secret_keys` are private. Use `account()`, `auth_secret_keys()` or `into_parts()`. `NoteSyncHint` likewise exposes `after_block_num()` and `tag()` ([#2594](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2594)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust,cli] The client now gets its protocol configuration from the node during `Client::sync_state` instead of being given one. `SyncChainMmr` carries the configuration when the client syncs from genesis or when the configuration commitment changed over the synced range, and the client verifies it against the block header before storing it ([#2591](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2591)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] State sync now authenticates the chain tip by verifying the block signatures against the validator configuration ([#2553](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2553)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `StateSync::new` now takes a `validator_config: ValidatorConfig` argument, used to authenticate the chain tip block header on every sync. The validator configuration can be retrieved from the client with `Client::get_validator_config` ([#2553](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2553)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `NodeRpcClient` gained a `register_account` method, which binds an invitation code to an account ID through the node's `RegisterAccount` endpoint ([#2532](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2532)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added `NodeRpcClient::is_account_allowed` and the `ClientError::AccountNotAllowlisted` and `ClientError::AccountAlreadyAllowed` variants ([#2550](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2550)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] `BatchBuilder::submit` returns the new `BatchBuilderError::BatchSubmissionOutcomeUnknown` when a submission comes back without a definite outcome, instead of `ClientError::RpcError`. It carries a `ProvenBatchSubmission` to resend with `Client::retry_proven_batch`. Rejections the node issues deliberately are unaffected, so code matching `ClientError::RpcError` still compiles but stops matching these cases ([#2508](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2508)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `BatchBuilderError::BatchSubmissionOutcomeUnknown` variant, so exhaustive matches on `BatchBuilderError` must handle it ([#2508](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2508)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient` takes the submitted payload by reference instead of by value: `submit_proven_transaction` takes `&ProvenTransaction` instead of `ProvenTransaction`, and `submit_proven_batch` takes `&ProvenBatch` and `&ProposedBatch` instead of `ProvenBatch` and `ProposedBatch`. An implementation that needs to own the payload must clone it itself ([#2508](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2508)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `TransactionRequestError::InputNoteBeingProcessed` variant, so exhaustive matches on `TransactionRequestError` must handle it ([#2583](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2583)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust,cli] Removed `Client::send_private_note`, `Client::send_private_note_with_block_hint`, `NoteTransportClient::send_note` and `NoteTransportClient::send_note_with_block_hint`, which used the note transport network's `SendNote` endpoint. Use `Client::send_private_note_with_proof` and `NoteTransportClient::send_note_with_proof` instead; a private note can only be relayed once its transaction is committed and the sender has synced past it. `send_note_with_proof` takes a validated `TransportNote` and is the only send method custom transports implement. `miden-client notes --send` errors when the stored note has no inclusion proof yet. Pending relay-outbox entries recorded by earlier versions carry no proof and are dropped on load ([#2611](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2611)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] `Client::add_account` and `Client::add_address` return the new `ClientError::AccountTagLimitExceeded` when the client already tracks `Client::MAX_ACCOUNT_TAGS` (128) account tags, the most the note transport accepts in one request ([#2627](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2627)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] `Client::sync_note_transport` and `Client::fetch_private_notes` return an error when the note transport returns a note that does not decode, whose details do not match its header, or whose tag was not requested. `Client::sync_state` logs the error and continues the chain sync ([#2630](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2630)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `NoteTransportError::InvalidFetchedNote` and `NoteTransportError::UnrequestedTag` variants ([#2630](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2630)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] Added `TransactionRequestBuilder::block_numbers` so callers can include selected blocks in a transaction's partial blockchain and in anchors captured with `Client::chain_anchor_for_request`. `TransactionRequest` now always serializes the block numbers, so request bytes written by earlier versions do not deserialize ([#2629](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2629), [#2625](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2625)).
* [BREAKING][removal][cli] `exec` now requires `--package` (`-p`). Removed `--script-path` (`-s`) and in-process MASM compilation. Compile scripts with `miden build` first. DAP sessions use package debug information and reload the compiled package on restart ([#2596](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2596)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Sync endpoints now report a `FutureBlock` error when the requested block is ahead of the node's chain tip. Endpoint errors now match the node's error codes, including new transaction submission errors, and unused error variants were removed ([#2623](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2623)).
* [BREAKING][arch][store] The SQLite store writes its structured values as protobuf messages instead of the `Serializable` encoding: transaction details and status, input and output note states, account code, note and transaction scripts, note assets, attachments, storage and metadata, block headers, partial blockchain peaks, and account witnesses. Requires a new client database ([#2624](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2624), [#2647](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2647)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] The `Store` trait requires five account-witness registry methods: `track_account_witness`, `untrack_account_witness`, `tracked_account_witnesses`, `get_account_witness` and `update_account_witness`. They have no default bodies, so every out-of-tree implementation must provide them ([#2476](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2476)).
* [BREAKING][api][rust,cli] Updated the node, remote prover and note transport clients to the v1 gRPC APIs of node `0.17.0-rc.4` ([#2651](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2651)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `AccountPatch` and `AccountDelta` carry their code as an `AccountCodePatch`. Code in a patch no longer means that the account is new, because a code upgrade also carries code. `AccountPatch::is_full_state` and `Account::try_from(&AccountPatch)` are removed. Use `AccountPatch::try_to_new_account` to build a new account from a creation patch ([#2642](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2642)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] Account code, note scripts and transaction scripts use the hashless MAST serialization of protocol `0.17.0`. A store that an earlier version created cannot read them and must be recreated ([#2642](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2642)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] `TransactionRequest` serializes the new code of an account code upgrade after its other fields, so request bytes that an earlier version wrote do not deserialize ([#2645](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2645)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust,cli] Removed unused items: the deprecated `ClientBuilder::tx_graceful_blocks` alias (use `tx_discard_delta`), the `NoteTransportUpdate` struct, the `AccountProofs` type alias, the `CliError::Internal` variant, and the test helpers `FaultyNoteTransportApi::fail_next_n` and `MockRpcApi::get_private_available_notes` ([#2661](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2661)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][cli] Added a `keys` command to list, generate, and import authentication keys, manage their account associations, and calculate a key commitment from a public key ([#2559](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2559)).
* [FEATURE][cli] `export --account` accepts a `--no-keys` flag, which leaves the account secret keys out of the exported `.mac` file. The file still carries the account seed while the account is undeployed ([#2556](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2556)).
* [FEATURE][rust] The committed note passed to the `OnNoteReceived` callback now always reports the note's resolved attachment content, whether the `SyncNotes` response carried it verbatim or a `GetNotesById` follow-up resolved it ([#2475](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2475)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Re-exported the fee pricing and note checking types that the client API already surfaces, so downstream crates no longer need a direct `miden-tx` dependency to price note consumption: `NetworkNotePricer`, `NotePricingError` and `NoteCheckerError` at the crate root, `TransactionFee` and `TransactionFeeError` from `transaction`, `NoteCost` and `NoteConsumptionCost` from `note`, and `MastForestStore` and `TransactionMastStore` from `testing` ([#2475](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2475)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::get_validator_config`, which returns the validator configuration committed by the locally stored block header at the current sync height ([#2553](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2553)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Endpoint::mainnet()`, `ClientBuilder::for_mainnet()`, `MAINNET_PROVER_ENDPOINT` and `NOTE_TRANSPORT_MAINNET_ENDPOINT`. The mainnet RPC endpoint maps to `NetworkId::Mainnet`, so addresses derived from it use the `mm` prefix ([#2569](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2569)).
* [FEATURE][cli] `init --network mainnet` configures the client for the Miden mainnet, including its note transport endpoint ([#2569](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2569)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added the optional `network_id` setting under `[rpc]` and the `init --network-id <HRP>` flag. They set the bech32 prefix the CLI renders and accepts for a node that is not one of the built-in endpoints, which otherwise maps to `mcst` ([#2569](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2569)).
* [FEATURE][rust] `Client::retry_proven_batch` resends a batch whose outcome was never confirmed, sealing the transaction inputs again on every attempt so nothing is executed or proven twice. It takes the `ProvenBatchSubmission` from `BatchBuilderError::BatchSubmissionOutcomeUnknown`, which has no public constructor, so that error is the only way to obtain one ([#2508](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2508)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added `account --register <ID> --invitation-code <CODE>`, which registers a tracked account on the network allowlist. When the network funds registered accounts, the command tells the user to `sync` and consume the funding note the node paid the account, which creates the account on chain ([#2545](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2545)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::register_account`, which binds an invitation code to a tracked new account that is not a network account ([#2545](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2545)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::is_account_allowed`. Submitting a transaction or batch that creates an account the network allowlist does not accept now fails with `ClientError::AccountNotAllowlisted` ([#2550](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2550)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added a `--package` option to `exec` so a compiled transaction script package (`.masp`) can be run instead of MASM source. A path without an extension is resolved in the package directory, as with `call --package` ([#2470](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2470)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added the mutually exclusive authentication scheme flags `--ecdsa-k256-keccak [PUBLIC_KEY]` and `--falcon512-poseidon2` (aliases `--ecdsa`, `--falcon`) to `new-wallet` and `new-account`. With an ECDSA public key, the account commits to the external key and stores no secret key. ECDSA accepts a `0x`-prefixed compressed or uncompressed SEC1 key. Without a public key, the CLI generates and stores a key of the selected scheme. `keys --commitment` now also accepts the 65-byte uncompressed SEC1 encoding ([#2590](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2590)).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli] Added `Client::send_private_note_with_proof` and `NoteTransportClient::send_note_with_proof`, which relay a private note together with its inclusion proof through the note transport network's `SendNoteWithProof` endpoint. The gRPC service verifies the proof before it stores the note, and recipients receive the exact commitment block instead of a hint. `miden-client notes --send` relays the stored note's proof ([#2611](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2611)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added support for account code upgrades. The store saves the new code when a local transaction or a synced public account update changes the code of an account, also when a large public account syncs through incremental patches. The store rejects a patch whose code does not match the new code commitment. Re-exported `AccountCodePatch`, `AccountCodeUpgrade`, `UpgradeNote`, `AccountCodeUpgradeAttachment`, `AccountCodeUpgradeAttachmentError` and `UpgradeManager` ([#2642](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2642)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `MockRpcApi::add_pending_executed_transaction`, which commits an executed transaction on the mock chain with a dummy proof ([#2642](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2642)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `TransactionRequestBuilder` helpers for account code upgrades. `account_code_upgrade` gives the new code to a transaction whose custom script upgrades the executing account. `build_account_code_upgrade` builds a request that upgrades the code of an account with `UpgradeManager` and `Authority::AuthControlled`. `TransactionRequest::account_code_upgrade` returns the new code of a request ([#2645](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2645)).

### Enhancements

* [rust] `Client::sync_state` fetches a Note Transport Layer page and the node's chain update concurrently, instead of running a full note transport sync before the chain sync. The transport notes are imported first and their records join the chain sync's note updates, so a note delivered and committed within the same sync is reported by that sync ([#2453](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2453)).
* [FEATURE][cli] `call` now takes an `account-id` argument as a bech32 address as well as a hex id, matching the spellings the rest of the CLI accepts for an account. This applies to the `account-id` type itself and to the faucet half of an `asset` token ([#2179](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2179)).
* [test] The testing node is installed from the node crates on crates.io instead of a git revision. Its genesis is built with that release's `miden-validator genesis` flags: the native faucet, a new funding account, the fee and the timestamp are passed on the command line and the remaining accounts through `--accounts-config` ([#2594](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2594)).
* [test] CI uses smaller runners for short jobs and cancels superseded pull request runs. Pull requests skip specialty system tests when unrelated files change, while pushes to `main` and `next` still run every test ([#2610](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2610)).
* [FEATURE][cli] The CLI logs the `.miden` directory it loaded the configuration from, and whether it is the local or the global one, at debug level. Run a command with `RUST_LOG=debug` to see it ([#2648](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2648)).
* [FEATURE][arch][rust] Added the `miden-client-proto` crate with the protobuf schemas and conversions of the miden-client types. `decode` runs all checks and `decode_unchecked` may skip the expensive ones for bytes from a trusted source. Output note states can include their note scripts or omit them when a store keeps scripts separately. `miden-client-sqlite-store` uses it for its stored values ([#2652](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2652)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::track_account_witness`, `Client::untrack_account_witness` and `Client::tracked_account_witnesses` to register accounts whose account witness the sync keeps fresh in the store (new `account_witnesses` table). A transaction using a registered account as a foreign account builds its inputs from the store instead of issuing a `GetAccount` request, moving the cost from once per transaction to once per sync ([#2476](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2476)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][cli] `new-account` and `new-wallet` accept a composite storage slot given as a single slot-level value in the init data file, instead of prompting for each field and then failing with a conflict ([#2534](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2534)).
* [FIX][rust] Refreshed tracked input notes after transport imports so the same sync detects their consumption ([#2453](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2453)).
* [FIX][rust] A private note fetched from the Note Transport Layer whose nullifier is already on chain is now imported as consumed instead of committed, so `get_consumable_notes` no longer reports notes the node will reject ([#2453](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2453)).
* [FIX][rust] Added validation of cached transaction encryption keys during deserialization. Unsupported encryption schemes and empty or oversized key IDs are rejected before reading the key ID bytes ([#2411](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2411)).
* [FIX][cli] `notes --list consumable` now respects the `--account-id` filter ([#2449](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2449)).
* [FIX][store] Every write transaction of the `SQLite` store begins as `IMMEDIATE`. A transaction that read before it wrote could fail the write-lock upgrade with `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`, which the busy timeout does not retry.
* [FIX][cli] A bech32 address encoded for a different network is now rejected, instead of being used as the account ID it carries on the configured network. This covers every account argument (`send`, `mint`, `consume-notes`, `call`, `export`, `account`), the recipient of `notes --send`, the faucet in an `<AMOUNT>::<FAUCET_ADDRESS>` asset, and the token symbol map, which no longer loads if an entry names an address of another network ([#2546](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2546)).
* [store] Simplified `SqliteStore::get_setting` to take `&Connection` directly without opening an unnecessary transaction ([#2449](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2449)).
* [FIX][cli] `miden-client import` now rejects invocations without a file path instead of silently succeeding ([#2450](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2450)).
* [FIX][rust] `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_swap` and `build_pswap_create` now reject a zero-amount asset on either side of the exchange. A zero requested asset produced a payback P2ID note carrying nothing, and a zero offered asset produced a note whose consumer pays and receives nothing ([#2459](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2459)).
* [FIX][test] The integration tests run again on a chain that charges no fee. A `--funders` path (`MIDEN_FUNDER_ACCOUNTS_DIR`) that is unset, empty, missing, or holds no `.mac` file now leaves the run without funders instead of failing, which is all a fee-free genesis needs, since it declares no wallets for the path to hold. A `.mac` file that is present but unusable stays a hard error ([#2481](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2481)).
* [FIX][rust] `VerifyingRpcClient::sync_nullifiers` now rejects an update stamped outside the requested `block_from`/`block_to` window with `RpcError::InvalidResponse`, in the same pass that checks the nullifier prefixes. `GrpcClient` rejects a page whose cursor ends past the requested `block_to` with `RpcError::PaginationError`, which covers every block-paginated method. Note blocks and transaction records were already range-checked by the sync ([#2503](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2503)).
* [FIX][store] `set_setting` and `remove_setting` return an error when the number of affected rows does not match the expected count ([#2537](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2537)).
* [FIX][rust] A request that consumes a note already held by a pending local transaction is now rejected with `TransactionRequestError::InputNoteBeingProcessed` before it is executed. Previously the transaction was executed, proven and submitted to the node, and only the local store update failed, leaving a submitted transaction without a local record ([#2583](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2583)).
* [FIX][cli] `new-account` and `new-wallet` now reject a package that exports procedures without an `@account_procedure` or `@auth_script` attribute. They also reject packages whose target kind is not `account-component` and packages without an account component metadata section ([#2542](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2542)).
* [FIX][rust] `TransactionRequestBuilder::expiration_delta` is now applied to requests without own output notes, such as `build_consume_notes` or a bare `build()`. Such a request runs the standard `ExpirationTransactionScript` with the delta as its script argument, where the delta was previously dropped and the transaction never expired ([#2580](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2580)).
* [FIX][store] `SqliteStore::update_account` keeps the seed of an account whose nonce is still zero, so overwriting an undeployed account (for example with `import --overwrite`) no longer leaves it undeployable ([#2541](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2541)).
* [FIX][cli] Packages resolved from the package directory are read with the trusted package reader ([#2568](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2568)).
* [FIX][rust] Missing block headers are fetched together with their MMR proof, avoiding a second node request for the same block while building transaction inputs or a chain anchor ([#2634](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2634)).
* [FIX][rust] State sync matches an included transaction to a local pending transaction by its ID only. An included transaction with an unknown ID from the same account and initial state no longer marks the local transaction as committed and is handled as an external transaction ([#2661](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2661)).

## 0.16.1 (2026-09-10)

### Changes

* [FEATURE][rust] New `miden-web3signer-authenticator` crate provides `Web3SignerAuthenticator`, which allows a Miden client to sign transactions with `EcdsaK256Keccak` keys held in a Web3Signer instance ([#2501](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2501)).
* Updated workspace version to 0.16.1 ([#2526](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2526)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][rust] `ForeignAccount` gained the `Prefetched(AccountInputs)` variant: a request can carry a foreign account's state and inclusion witness, and nothing is fetched for that account at execution time. `Client::get_foreign_account_inputs` is now public and fetches inputs for a set of declarations at a given block. Together they let a transaction pinned to an older block execute after the node stopped serving account state there. Exhaustive matches on `ForeignAccount` must handle the new variant. Requests without prefetched accounts keep their serialized format ([#2524](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2524)).

## 0.16.0 (2026-09-07)

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][behavior][rust,web] `TransactionRequest` serialization now carries the pinned input notes, so a request serialized by an earlier version cannot be deserialized by this one and vice versa. Rebuild any request that is stored or in flight across the upgrade ([#2437](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2437)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] Removed `Client::try_get_account`. Use `Client::get_account` and handle the `None` case, or `Client::account_reader` for existence checks and single-field reads that don't need the full materialized account ([#2362](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2362)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `StorageMapEntries::EntriesWithProofs(Vec<SmtProof>)` is replaced by `StorageMapEntries::PartialMap { map_keys, partial_smt }`. Read a value by hashing its raw key and calling `PartialSmt::get_value`. The enum also gained a `LimitExceeded` variant, replacing `AccountStorageMapDetails::too_many_entries` ([#2431](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2431)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `SyncedNote` splits the content it carries into two fields, `details: Option<NoteDetails>` and `attachments: NoteAttachments`, replacing the previous `content: Option<ResolvedNoteContent>`; `SyncedNote::new` takes them as separate arguments. `ResolvedNoteContent` is removed. Attachments are no longer optional, a note whose metadata advertises none carries an empty set, so "no attachments" and "attachments not resolved" are no longer the same value ([#2431](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2431)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NoteObserver::observe` takes `&NoteAttachments` instead of `Option<&NoteAttachments>`. A note that carries no attachments is reported with an empty set ([#2431](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2431)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] `impl TryFrom<proto::rpc::AccountResponse> for AccountProof` is removed. Use `proto::rpc::account_response::AccountDetails::into_domain` with the `AccountStorageRequirements` the request was built from ([#2431](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2431)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] Foreign `AccountInputs` keep a fetched asset list only when it hashes to the account header's vault root; otherwise (omitted because unchanged, capped as oversize, or malformed) they carry a root-only partial vault, and any assets the foreign code reads are resolved during execution as per-asset witnesses — served from the local store first, falling back to fetching the vault via RPC at the transaction reference block and verifying it against the required root ([#2417](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2417)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] Foreign `AccountInputs` likewise keep a fetched storage-map entry list only when it hashes to the slot's root in the storage header; otherwise (capped as oversize, or malformed) the map is carried root-only and any keys the foreign code reads are resolved during execution as lazy per-key witnesses, instead of syncing an oversized map's full history from genesis before executing ([#2417](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2417)).
* [BREAKING][arch][store] The account SMT forest now persists in SQLite (new `forest_trees`, `forest_entries`, `forest_subtrees` and `forest_revision` tables) through a `LargeSmtForest` backend scoped to the store's own transaction, so forest mutations commit or roll back atomically with the account tables and opening the store no longer rebuilds the forest from account data. Tree inner nodes are persisted as packed subtree blobs, so witness reads load a single leaf plus eight blobs instead of rebuilding the account's tree, making their cost independent of the account's map size at the price of a larger store file. Tree updates are computed path-locally from the persisted leaves and subtree blobs, so committed update cost scales with the size of the change set rather than with the map size. Existing stores are not compatible and must be recreated ([#2333](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2333)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] `AccountSmtForest` is now generic over the forest storage `BackendReader`, with updates additionally requiring `Backend`, and is constructed per store operation. The in-memory root-staging API (`stage_roots`, `commit_roots`, `discard_roots`, `replace_roots`, `get_roots`) and the node-insertion helpers were removed. Trees are addressed by account ID and storage slot name rather than by root: `miden_client::store` now exports only `AccountSmtForest` and `AccountUpdate`, with lineage identifiers, update batches and their miden-crypto types kept internal ([#2333](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2333)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `rpc::domain::transaction::TransactionRecord` gained a non-public field, so it can no longer be constructed with a struct literal outside the crate ([#2300](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2300)).
* [BREAKING][rust] `StateSyncUpdate` is now immutable once built: its `block_num`, `partial_blockchain_updates`, `note_updates`, `transaction_updates` and `account_updates` fields are private and it no longer implements `Default`. Build one with `StateSyncUpdate::from_parts`, read it through the same-named accessors, and take ownership of the contents with `into_parts` ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `PartialBlockchainUpdates::insert` no longer takes the block's MMR authentication nodes; stage them separately with the new `extend_authentication_nodes` ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [BREAKING][rust] Transaction fees moved out of the kernel epilogue and into the authentication procedure. On a chain whose `verification_base_fee` is non-zero, signature-based auth components (`AuthSingleSig`, `AuthMultisig`) require the transaction to commit fee conversion info, and the paying account must hold a balance of the fee asset. The client commits it for you, paying in the chain's native fee asset at rate 1/1 (see the enhancement below). Chains that charge no fee are unaffected.
* [BREAKING][rename][rust] Protocol renames surfaced through the client's re-exports: `miden_client::assembly::Library` is removed (packages are the only representation now, use `miden_client::vm::Package`).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] Network accounts now require a fee policy: `AuthNetworkAccount::with_allowed_notes` → `AuthNetworkAccount::new(notes, FeePolicyManager)` and `NetworkAccount::builder` takes a `FeePolicyManager`. Every allowlisted note script must have an explicit fee-schedule entry, including a zero one, because a script root missing from the schedule aborts fee estimation rather than defaulting to free. `AuthNetworkAccount` also no longer converts into a single `AccountComponent`: it yields the auth component plus its fee policy components, so it must be passed to `with_components`.
* [BREAKING][rust] Removed the `AuthSingleSigAcl` and `AuthSingleSigAclConfig` re-exports along with the `auth/acl-auth`. Use `AuthSingleSig`, which requires a signature for every call, or `NoAuth` where no authentication is wanted.
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `send_notes` transaction script now reads its payload from the advice provider and requires the payload commitment as its transaction script argument. The client binds that argument automatically, so a `TransactionRequestBuilder::script_arg` set alongside a `SendNotes` template is ignored; it still applies to caller-supplied custom scripts.
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] Creating a note that carries a `NetworkAccountTarget` attachment now performs a foreign procedure invocation into the target account to price the note, even on a chain that charges no fees. Such transactions must supply the target network account as a foreign account, anchored at a reference block that already commits it.
* [BREAKING][rust] Transaction inputs are now sealed before submission. The client fetches the validator set's shared encryption key on first submission and verifies its validator attestations against the validator set committed in the chain tip before using it. A client must be synced far enough to have a genesis header and a chain-tip header locally before it can submit. `NodeRpcClient::submit_proven_transaction` and `NodeRpcClient::submit_proven_batch` now take `SealedTransactionInputs` instead of `TransactionInputs`.
* [BREAKING][rename][rust] `NoteScreener::can_consume` → `NoteScreener::get_consumability` and `NoteScreener::can_consume_batch` → `NoteScreener::get_batch_consumability`. The new names reflect that both return a `NoteConsumptionStatus` per account rather than a boolean ([#2338](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2338)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] Transaction inputs are now encrypted on submission, so the RPC operator relaying them cannot read them. `Client::submit_proven_transaction` seals the inputs against the validator set's shared transaction encryption key: on first use it fetches the key from the node, verifies a validator attestation for it against the validator set committed in a trusted block header (binding the genesis commitment, so an attestation cannot be replayed from another network), and caches the verified key in the store's settings table, evicting it when the node rejects a submission sealed against a retired key so the next submission re-fetches. Requires a node that unseals submitted inputs; such nodes reject plaintext submissions ([#2341](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2341)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient` models encrypted submissions: `submit_proven_transaction` now takes `SealedTransactionInputs` instead of `TransactionInputs`, `submit_proven_batch` now takes `Vec<SealedTransactionInputs>` (one per transaction, each sealed against its own transaction ID), and implementations must provide the new `get_transaction_encryption_key` method ([#2341](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2341)).
* [BREAKING][removal][cli] Removed the `account --show --with-code` flag. Use `account --inspect <ID> --verbose` to view procedure disassembly. ([#2312](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2312)).
* [BREAKING][removal][cli] Removed the `--deploy` flag from `new-wallet` and `new-account`. It submitted an empty transaction as the deploy, which cannot pay its own fee on a fee-charging chain. A self-funding replacement may come with the `deploy` command proposed in [#1397](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1397) ([#2455](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2455)).
* [BREAKING][rename][cli] Renamed the `token_symbol_map.toml` Bech32 field from `id` to `address` ([#2377](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2377)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `NoteFilter::ScriptRoots` variant, so exhaustive matches on `NoteFilter` in `Store` implementations must handle it ([#2335](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2335)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] `SqliteStore::new` rejects a database path that is not valid UTF-8 ([#2363](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2363)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rpc] The `SyncNotes` response now carries a reduced note metadata message: instead of the note's attachments commitment it carries one entry per attachment, with single-word attachments sent verbatim and larger ones sent as commitments. The client reconstructs the protocol-level `NoteMetadata` from those entries, so it requires a node that speaks this format.
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] The SQLite base schema now declares an index on `input_notes(script_root)`. This changes the schema fingerprint, so opening a database created before this change fails with `SchemaDrift` and existing stores must be recreated ([#2335](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2335)).
* [BREAKING][removal][store] `miden-client-sqlite-store` no longer exposes the internal helpers `column_value_as_u64` and `u64_to_value`, nor the connection-taking `SqliteStore` write methods (`apply_transaction`, `apply_transaction_batch`, `upsert_foreign_account_code`, `prune_account_history`, `prune_irrelevant_blocks`); they are now crate-private. Use the `Store` trait methods instead ([#2351](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2418)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] Removed the `TransactionFilter::ExpiredBefore` variant. Transaction expiry is decided during state sync from each transaction's `expiration_block_num`, so nothing queried the store for it; exhaustive matches on `TransactionFilter` must drop the arm ([#2364](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2364)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `Store::get_input_note_by_offset` is replaced by `Store::get_input_note_after`, which takes an `Option<InputNoteCursor>` identifying the last note read instead of an ordinal offset. Build the cursor for the next call with `InputNoteCursor::from_record`. `Store` implementations must be updated; `InputNoteReader` is unaffected ([#2364](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2364)).
* [BREAKING][removal][rust] `miden_client::agglayer::create_bridge_account` and `miden_client::agglayer::create_agglayer_faucet` are removed. Build the accounts with `AggLayerBridge::account_builder` and `AggLayerFaucet::account_builder`, which return an `AccountBuilder` and take the account's `FeePolicyManager` explicitly; its active policy must be a `BasicConstantFeePolicy` scheduling every root in the account's `allowed_notes()`. The faucet builder additionally takes the initial token supply and the account seeding its `ADMIN` role.
* [BREAKING][rust] `Client::add_note_tag` and `Client::remove_note_tag` return `bool` instead of `()`, reporting whether the tag was actually added or removed. Both used to swallow that outcome and only log it ([#2416](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2416)).
* [BREAKING][rust] `Client::remove_setting` and `Store::remove_setting` return `bool` instead of `()`, reporting whether the key had a value set.
* [BREAKING][rust] `Client::remove_address` and `Store::remove_address` return `bool` instead of `()`, reporting whether the address was tracked. When it wasn't, `Client::remove_address` now leaves the derived note tag in place instead of running its cleanup.
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Added the `TransactionRequestError::ForeignProcedureInputsTooLong` variant ([#2187](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2187)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] The `output_notes` table gained a nullable `script_root` column referencing `notes_scripts`, and note scripts are fully normalized: an output note's state blob no longer embeds the script, which is stored once in `notes_scripts` and joined back in on read. All tables are now `STRICT`, and the `tags` table stores its rows keyed by a `(tag, source)` primary key (`WITHOUT ROWID`) instead of carrying a separate unique index. This changes the schema fingerprint, so opening a database created before this change fails with `SchemaHashMismatch` and existing stores must be recreated.
* [BREAKING][param][store] Settings are split into a client-owned and a user-owned scope. `Store::set_setting`, `Store::get_setting`, `Store::remove_setting`, `Store::list_setting_keys` and `Store::apply_settings_mutations` take a `SettingScope` as their first argument, and implementations must persist it so the same key name in each scope addresses a different entry. The `Client` methods are unchanged and always operate on `SettingScope::User` ([#2456](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2456)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] `Client::list_setting_keys` returns only the user's keys. The client's own entries, such as the note transport cursor and the cached RPC limits, no longer appear in the listing and can no longer be read or overwritten through the `Client` settings API ([#2456](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2456)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] The SQLite `settings` table now carries a `scope` column with `(scope, name)` as its primary key. This changes the schema fingerprint, so opening a database created before this change fails with `SchemaDrift` and existing stores must be recreated ([#2456](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2456)).
* [BREAKING][rust] Updated the protocol dependencies to `0.16.1`, which raises the MSRV to 1.98.1. `guarded_multisig.masm` and `multisig_smart.masm` both call `fee::load_conversion_info` as of `0.16.0-rc.9`, so `AuthMultisigSmart` now reads the auth argument as fee conversion info rather than as a summary salt alone and, like the other multisig components, must declare its own salt on a fee-charging chain ([#2465](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2465), [#2511](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2511)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][rust] A transaction submission that comes back without a definite outcome no longer surfaces as `ClientError::RpcError`. `Client::submit_proven_transaction`, and every path through it, returns the new `ClientError::SubmissionOutcomeUnknown`, which carries the `ProvenTransaction` and the `TransactionInputs` it was submitted with, so the caller can hand them straight back to `submit_proven_transaction` without executing or proving again, or track the transaction id until a sync resolves it. Rejections the node issues deliberately are unaffected. Code matching on `ClientError::RpcError` for submission failures still compiles but stops matching these cases. The classification is available as `RpcError::is_indeterminate_submission` ([#2498](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2498)).

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Added `TransactionRequestBuilder::explicit_input_notes` so callers can pin each input note as authenticated or unauthenticated instead of deriving its mode from the executing client's store ([#2437](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2437)).
* [FEATURE][rust] `ClientBuilder` accepts any `TransactionAuthenticator + 'static` as its authenticator. The `BuilderAuthenticator` bound no longer requires `Keystore` or `From<FilesystemKeyStore>`, so a signer that holds no secret key, such as a remote signing service, can be plugged into the builder without implementing key management.
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `AuthGuardedMultisig`, `AuthGuardedMultisigConfig`, `GuardianConfig` and `ApproverSet` to `miden_client::auth`, which previously exposed only the single- and multisig components. Building a guarded multisig account no longer means reaching past the client into `miden_standards` ([#2465](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2465)).
* [FEATURE][rust] `Client::sync_state` now issues its independent gRPC calls concurrently instead of one after another, reducing the total time a sync takes. `NodeRpcClient::sync_notes_with_content` and `NodeRpcClient::sync_transactions` are now called concurrently rather than in sequence, and the per-account `NodeRpcClient::get_account` requests are issued in parallel instead of one at a time ([#2420](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2420)).
* [store] Added `SqliteStore::database_filepath`, which returns the backing database path losslessly as a `&Path` ([#2363](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2363)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Syncing no longer issues a `GetNotesById` request for a note whose attachments the `SyncNotes` response already carried verbatim. Both standard attachment schemes in `miden-standards` fit in a single word and arrive inline, so the round trip disappears from the common case. An attachment spanning more than one word arrives as a commitment and is still fetched ([#2431](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2431)).
* [FEATURE][rust] `CommittedNote` now carries the attachment content its source reported, exposed through `attachments()`, `needs_attachment_fetch()` and `with_attachments()`, which rejects content that does not hash to the metadata's attachments commitment ([#2431](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2431)).
* [FEATURE][rust] On a chain whose reference block charges a non-zero `verification_base_fee`, the client now commits fee conversion info paying the fee in the chain's native fee asset at rate 1/1, so a transaction against an `AuthSingleSig` account no longer has to opt in per request. `AuthMultisig` reuses the commitment's salt as its replay guard, so a request against such an account declares a fresh salt with the new `TransactionRequestBuilder::fee_conversion_salt` and the client commits the native info under it ([#2446](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2446)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `ChainAnchor` with `Client::execute_transaction_at` and `Client::chain_anchor_for_request` to capture and execute against a pinned reference block instead of the sync height, so a transaction summary signed at one block — which binds the reference block commitment since protocol 0.16 — can be reproduced and executed later on any client ([#2421](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2421)).
* [FEATURE][rust] A client that only watches a public account now recovers notes the account consumed authenticated, even when it never tracked them by tag. During sync it reads the note references the node attaches to the account's transactions, fetches each note body by id, and surfaces it through `InputNoteReader`. Requires node `0.15.1` ([#2300](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2300)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added a `--payback-note-type` option to `swap` so the payback note can be created as public or private (defaults to private). Public payback works without any off-band advice now that SWAP derives the payback recipient deterministically ([#2190](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2190)).
* [FEATURE][cli] `init` now also writes the non-fungible faucet, guarded multisig auth and network account auth component packages ([#2356](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2356)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added the `NonFungibleFaucet` component re-export to `miden_client::account::component` ([#2356](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2356)).
* [FEATURE][rust] A request that declares a fee conversion salt against an account whose auth component cannot read conversion info is now rejected before execution, with `TransactionRequestError::FeeConversionInfoUnsupported` ([#2356](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2356)).
* [FEATURE][rust] `Client::get_consumable_notes(Some(account_id))` now screens only that account instead of screening every tracked account and discarding the rest, so its cost no longer grows with the number of tracked accounts. Added `NoteScreener::get_batch_consumability_for_account` to screen notes against a single account ([#2338](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2338)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added the `miden_client::rpc::encryption` module backing encrypted submissions: `TransactionEncryptionKey`, `AttestedTransactionEncryptionKey` (whose `verify` is the only path to a usable key), `ValidatorAttestation`, `NextTransactionEncryptionKey`, `SealedTransactionInputs` and `seal_transaction_inputs`, along with re-exports of the validator DSA key types reachable from this API ([#2341](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2341)).
* [FEATURE][rust,store] Added `NoteFilter::ScriptRoots` to query input notes by their note script root directly at the store level, without loading and screening unrelated notes. The filter doesn't apply to output notes: querying output notes with it returns an empty list ([#2335](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2335)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::get_latest_block_header`, which returns the block header stored at the current sync height.
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `InputNoteState::is_unspent` and `InputNoteRecord::is_unspent`, which report whether a note hasn't been nullified yet and can still be consumed, along with the `InputNoteState::UNSPENT_STATES` discriminant list that backs them and lets a store filter on the persisted discriminant. `Invalid` notes are neither unspent nor consumed ([#2364](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2364)).
* [FEATURE][store] Added the `miden-bench store` subcommand, which measures how the `SQLite` store methods scale with the number of notes and accounts and reports the growth between the smallest and the largest size. It seeds its own throwaway databases and needs no node, and `make bench-store` runs the same sweep CI does ([#2364](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2364)).
* [rust] Added `PartialBlockchainUpdates::block_headers_to_store`, which narrows the staged headers to the ones a sync must persist: those marked as relevant, genesis, and the block at the sync height. `block_headers` still yields all staged headers ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [rust] State sync now authenticates every relevant note block but only persists block headers and MMR authentication nodes for blocks containing notes that remain unspent or that a `NoteObserver` explicitly marks as relevant ([#2297](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2297)).
* [rust,store] Single-transaction execution no longer reconstructs the full `Account`: the client works from the minimal partial account, and request validation checks balances against the vault asset list fetched via the new `Store::get_account_assets` (exposed as `AccountReader::assets`). Executor vault witnesses — including emptiness proofs for assets being added — are served by the new `Store::get_vault_asset_witnesses`, which `SqliteStore` answers directly from its Merkle forest instead of rebuilding the vault ([#2362](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2362)).
* [cli] `account --list`, `account show` and `call` no longer load full accounts from the store: faucet token symbols and decimals are read from the faucet's token config storage slot, and `call` checks the account header while reading untracked public accounts from the network ([#2362](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2362)).
* [store] Added schema version 2 (`0002_index_tuning.sql`), which indexes `code_commitment` on `latest_account_headers`, `historical_account_headers` and `foreign_account_code`, leads the `input_notes` consumption index with `consumer_account_id`, carries `nullifier` in the `input_notes` state index, narrows the `transactions` status index to pending rows, and drops the `transactions.block_num` column, whose value is already part of the serialized details. Stores built at version 1 are migrated when they are opened ([#2364](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2364)).
* [store] The SQLite store's schema is now built from append-only migrations under `crates/sqlite-store/src/migrations/`, starting with the frozen `0001_init.sql`. Opening a store verifies its schema against a fingerprint derived by replaying the migrations, before migrating and then again for each version an upgrade builds, while it is still uncommitted. A version that builds an unexpected schema is rejected there, so the upgrade is rolled back and the store is left as it was. A pinned snapshot of the fingerprints and a CI job together reject any pull request that modifies an existing migration file ([#2346](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2346)).
* [rust] `BatchBuilder` now stacks in-batch account state as a `PartialAccount` updated with each transaction's `AccountPatch` instead of reconstructing the full `Account` after every push. Witnesses at the in-batch state are built by replaying the batch's writes onto committed-state proofs, so any `Store` backend supports batches through the witness methods it already implements ([#2277](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2277)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added `account --inspect <ID>[:<PROCEDURE>]` to list the procedures an account exposes, grouped into resolved procedures (with their names and signatures) and unresolved ones (listed by MAST root). Names and signatures are resolved from the `.masp` packages in the configured packages directory plus any passed via `--package` (`-p`). `--verbose` prints each procedure's MASM disassembly. ([#2312](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2312)).
* Improved the output of the `miden-client init` command when a configuration already exists ([#2357](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2357)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added DAP-based transaction debugging with offline record/replay. `miden-client exec` and `consume-notes` accept `--start-debug-adapter <ADDR>` to run a transaction — script, kernel, note scripts, and account code — under a DAP client (e.g. the `miden-debug` TUI) instead of proving and submitting it (`consume-notes` is backed by a new `Client::execute_transaction_with_dap`). During the session the advice mutations produced by the transaction host's event handlers are recorded — readable via the handle from `DapConfig::record_event_mutations()`, and reported by the CLI — and `--record <FILE>` writes a self-contained replay snapshot (program, inputs, resolved code, and event log) that can be replayed offline with `miden-debug --replay <FILE>`, with no node, client, or account state. This uses the `miden-debug` 0.9.2 release ([#2306](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2306)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `miden_client::transaction::build_fpi_script`, which builds a transaction script that invokes a procedure on a foreign account ([#2187](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2187)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::get_account_header`, which reads a single account's header and status from the store instead of loading every tracked account's ([#2187](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2187)).
* [FEATURE][cli] `call` now works on public accounts that aren't tracked locally: the account is read from the network via a foreign procedure invocation, run from one of the client's own accounts (the default account when set). Such calls are read-only, so no state delta is shown. `--package` (`-p`) is now optional; if not set, `<PROCEDURE>` must be a hex digest and the output stack is printed as raw felts ([#2187](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2187)).
* [rust] `Client::execute_transaction`, `Client::execute_transaction_with_dap`, `Client::execute_program`, `Client::execute_program_with_dap`, `Client::set_setting` and `Client::remove_setting` now take `&self` instead of `&mut self`; none of them mutate the client ([#2187](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2187)).
* [FEATURE][cli] `call` reads the procedure's signature from the package manifest: it prints the signature with type names (`add-points(point, point) -> point`), takes each argument as one token of its own type (an `account-id` as `0x..`, an `asset` as `<AMOUNT>::<FAUCET_ID>`) and renders the result the same way. A procedure exported without a WIT signature keeps the raw-felt path, with its arguments written in decimal and its results printed as a stack dump. Arguments that don't fit the stack the called procedure can see are now rejected instead of arriving as zeros, and a procedure that only reads reports that the transaction was rejected for having no effects ([#2179](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2179)).

### Changes

* [rust] Re-exported the typed view over a package's exported signatures as `miden_client::vm::typed`, `TransactionExecutorError` from the crate root, and `ExecutionError`, `OperationError` and `error_code_from_msg` as `miden_client::vm`, so callers can match a failed transaction against a specific kernel assertion ([#2179](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2179)).
* [store] Each SQL migration now carries the fingerprint of the schema it builds. Opening a store checks every version it applies against that version's own pin, so a migration edited to build a different schema is rejected even when creating a fresh database ([#2445](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2445)).
* [FEATURE][rust] `TransactionRequestBuilder::expected_output_recipients` now takes any `IntoIterator` whose items convert into `NoteRecipient`, matching `own_output_notes` and `foreign_accounts`, so recipients no longer have to be collected into a `Vec<NoteRecipient>` first. Callers already passing a `Vec<NoteRecipient>` are unaffected ([#2499](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2499)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][store] Corrupted database contents now surface as `StoreError`s instead of panicking: undecodable account IDs, nonces, and note-script blobs, a missing blockchain-checkpoint row, and a zero MMR node id all return errors, and rusqlite errors on parameterized note/account queries are no longer converted through panicking `expect`s ([#2351](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2351)).
* [FIX][store] `u64` columns written with the top bit set (stored as negative SQL INTEGERs) are now read back through the shared bit-cast helper everywhere; two read sites previously errored on such values ([#2351](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2351)).
* [FIX][test] The integration tests now run against a fee-charging chain. The testing node's genesis charges a fee by default (`MIDEN_VERIFICATION_BASE_FEE`, default `500`), generates the native fee faucet itself so the accounts it deploys can be seeded with that asset, and pre-funds a pool of basic wallets the suite draws from via a new `--funders` argument (`MIDEN_FUNDER_ACCOUNTS_DIR`). Accounts created by the `miden_client::testing::common` helpers are funded and deployed automatically, and `miden_client::testing::fee::deploy_account` does the same for accounts a test builds itself. The AggLayer accounts are consequently always part of genesis (the `AGGLAYER_GENESIS` env var and the `start-node-agglayer` target are gone) and the AggLayer tests load them from `AGGLAYER_ACCOUNTS_DIR` ([#2446](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2446)).
* [FIX][test] The AggLayer genesis accounts now declare their zero-fee policy in the faucet the generated genesis charges fees in, rather than the mock chain's. A network account settles its fee against the faucet its own policy names, so the bridge's and faucet's network transactions could not be executed and their notes sat unconsumed, failing `agglayer_update_ger` and `agglayer_note_reader_reads_consumed_notes` ([#2446](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2446)).
* [FIX][rust] An empty auth argument no longer suppresses the fee conversion info the client attaches, and an account whose auth component reads that argument as a caller-chosen salt (`AuthMultisig`, `AuthGuardedMultisig`) is now rejected with `TransactionRequestError::FeeConversionInfoRequired` instead of failing inside the VM, unless the request declares a salt with `TransactionRequestBuilder::fee_conversion_salt`. Accounts carrying an auth component the client cannot classify are left alone rather than panicking ([#2446](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2446)).
* [FIX][rust] Note screening on a fee-charging chain no longer reports notes with a custom script as unconsumable. Screening runs the full transaction kernel, auth procedure included, so `fee::pay_fee` aborted when a non-zero fee met auth args carrying no conversion info, and the note was dropped from the sync. Screening now commits the same native conversion info the execution path attaches, drawn from one shared source so the two cannot disagree. Standard notes were unaffected: their consumability is answered without executing anything ([#2446](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2446)).
* [FIX][rust] A transaction's own TX_FEE note is no longer recorded as one of the paying account's output notes either. It is a bearer note for whoever builds the batch, so tracking it returned it from `get_output_notes` as a note the user created, listed it in `miden-client notes`, and fed its nullifier prefix into `sync_nullifiers` on every sync. The raw output list is still kept verbatim on the transaction record ([#2465](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2465), [#2484](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2484)).
* [FIX][rust] A transaction's own TX_FEE note is no longer tracked as an input note the paying account could consume. It is a bearer note, so the note screener reported it as consumable, and tracking it registered its note tag: every TX_FEE note on a chain shares one tag, so from a client's first fee-paying transaction onwards every sync pulled in every fee note the chain had produced ([#2446](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2446)).
* [FIX][rust] The RPC retry policy is now endpoint-aware: `SubmitProvenTransaction` and `SubmitProvenBatch` retry only `ResourceExhausted` and let `Unavailable` propagate, while read endpoints keep retrying both. `Unavailable` does not say whether the node processed the request, so resubmitting could hit the nullifier consumed by an accepted copy and report a conflict indistinguishable from a genuine double spend, hiding the original success ([#2441](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2441)).
* [FIX][cli] `-V`/`--version` now work when the binary is invoked under a different name, such as through the `miden client` shim installed by midenup ([#2486] https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2486)).
* [FIX][rust] `ChainAnchor` deserialization no longer panics on crafted input: a partial blockchain whose tracked leaf is missing an ancestor sibling, or whose block-map key disagrees with its header, is rejected as an invalid value, and anchors tracking more blocks than a transaction can reference are rejected early with the new `ChainAnchorError::TooManyTrackedBlocks` ([#2421](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2421)).
* [FIX][rust] `Client::execute_transaction_at` now fails with the new `ChainAnchorError::AnchoredTransactionExpired` when the executed transaction's expiration block has already been reached, instead of handing back a transaction the network would reject after proving ([#2421](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2421)).
* [FIX][rust] A request that sets `ignore_invalid_input_notes` but carries no input notes, or whose notes are all screened out, no longer fails with an out-of-range note-count error from the consumption checker ([#2421](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2421)).
* [FIX][rust] Foreign procedure invocation against a tracked public account with a non-empty vault no longer fails with `ERR_FOREIGN_ACCOUNT_INVALID_COMMITMENT`. The client requests the foreign vault conditionally on its local vault root, and the node's omitted asset list — indistinguishable from an empty vault — was rebuilt into an empty vault and a wrong account commitment. Reconstruction now keeps an asset list only when it hashes to the header's vault root, degrading to a root-only vault served by lazy per-asset witnesses otherwise ([#2417](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2417)).
* [FIX][rust] The lazy storage-map witness fetch is now anchored at the transaction reference block instead of the chain tip, so a foreign procedure reading a storage map of an account updated after the caller's last sync no longer fails merkle verification inside the VM. A proof that still verifies against a different root than the executor requires is rejected with an error naming both roots ([#2417](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2417)).
* [FIX][cli] `miden-client init` now reports invalid remote prover endpoints instead of silently writing a local-prover config ([#2376](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2376)).
* [FIX][rust] Note import now skips notes whose inclusion proof claims a commit height beyond the synced view, instead of panicking while authenticating them ([#2400](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2400)).
* [FIX][rust] A note is now confirmed only by the header of the block its inclusion proof names. A header for any other block invalidates the note instead of committing it, even when the note path verifies against that block's note root, so a record can no longer be stored as committed at a block its proof does not authenticate it in ([#2400](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2400)).
* [FIX][rust] `VerifyingRpcClient::sync_notes` now validates that every returned note's inclusion proof claims the block the note was returned in, rejecting mismatches with `RpcError::InvalidResponse`. The two are independent fields of the response, so a node contradicting itself is caught before either sync path consumes the note ([#2400](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2400)).
* [FIX][rust] `VerifyingRpcClient::sync_transactions` now validates that every returned transaction record's account ID was actually requested, rejecting mismatches with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2372](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2372)).
* [FIX][rust] `Client::prove_transaction_with` now checks that the `TransactionProver` returned a proof of the transaction it was asked to prove, rejecting a mismatch with the new `ClientError::MismatchedProvenTransaction` ([#2391](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2391)).
* [FIX][cli] `miden-client notes --show` now prints the note sender in the `Sender` row; it was printing the note tag there ([#2412](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2412)).
* [FIX][cli] `miden-client tags --add` and `--remove` now report what actually happened instead of always printing that the tag was added or removed ([#2416](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2416)).
* [FIX][cli] `miden-client account --default none` now reports whether a default account was actually removed instead of always printing that it was. Removing an absent setting also no longer panics in debug builds ([#2439](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2439)).
* [FIX][cli] `miden-client address remove` now reports whether the address was actually removed instead of always printing that it was being removed.
* [FIX][rust] `VerifyingRpcClient::get_account` now validates that the returned `AccountProof` belongs to the requested account ID, rejecting a mismatch with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2419](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2419)).
* [FIX][rust] `Client::fetch_remote_token_metadata` now rejects a faucet whose token config reports more decimals than `FungibleFaucet::MAX_DECIMALS`, instead of caching the out-of-range value and rendering every balance for that faucet with it ([#2423](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2423)).
* [FIX][rust] On wasm32 the node RPC and note transport gRPC clients now apply the configured request timeout instead of silently ignoring it, so a request whose response never arrives fails with `deadline_exceeded` rather than hanging forever. Long-lived note streams are exempt, as the fetch-level timeout would abort a stream that is still delivering updates ([#2452](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2452)).
* [FIX][rust] `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_mint_fungible_asset` now rejects a zero-amount asset with `TransactionRequestError::P2IDNoteWithoutAsset`, matching `build_pay_to_id`; both emit a P2ID note, and minting nothing produced one the target could draw nothing from ([#2457](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2457)).
* [FIX][rust] `InputNoteReader::next` now fails with `ClientError::MissingNoteConsumptionPosition` when the store yields a note that carries no consumption position. The walk cannot advance past such a note, and it previously restarted from the first note on every subsequent call ([#2364](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2364)).
* [FIX][store] Input notes listed with `NoteFilter::Consumed` now break ties on the details commitment instead of the note ID, so notes consumed by the same transaction come back in a stable order. A note only carries an ID once its metadata is known, which left the previous tie-break undefined for the rest ([#2364](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2364)).

## 0.16.0-alpha.1 (2026-07-17)

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][rust] `NodeRpcClient` implementations are now raw transports: the echo checks that verified node responses against the request moved from `GrpcClient` into the new `VerifyingRpcClient` wrapper. `ClientBuilder::grpc_client` and the network constructors wrap their gRPC client automatically; clients passed via `ClientBuilder::rpc` are used as provided, so wrap them in `VerifyingRpcClient` to keep verified responses ([#2278](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2278)).
* [BREAKING][rust][cli] Removed the client debug-mode toggle: `DebugMode`, `ClientBuilder::in_debug_mode`, `Client::in_debug_mode`, the CLI `--debug` flag, and the `MIDEN_DEBUG` environment variable are gone, along with the `debug_mode` parameter of `CliClient::new`/`CliClient::from_config`. Miden VM 0.24 replaced the flag-gated `debug.*` MASM decorators with `miden::core::debug` procedures whose output the transaction executor prints by default, so the toggle no longer had anything to gate. ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [BREAKING][rust] Migrated to `miden-protocol` 0.16. Transaction-level fees were removed, block-level `FeeParameters` are unchanged. The relative `AccountDelta` model was replaced by the absolute `AccountPatch` model for account updates: `TransactionResult::account_delta` is now `account_patch`, `AccountUpdateDetails::Public` now carries an `AccountPatch`, account reconstruction is done via `Account::try_from(&AccountPatch)` or `Account::apply_patch` instead of previous `apply_delta`. Re-exports changed accordingly: `AccountStorageDelta` for `AccountStoragePatch`, `StorageMapDelta` for `StorageMapPatch`, and so on. Standards APIs were updated: `AuthMethod` was removed (use the concrete auth components), `create_fungible_faucet` was replaced by auth-specific variants such as `create_singlesig_user_fungible_faucet`. ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [BREAKING][rust][cli] Fungible amounts in the public API now use `AssetAmount` instead of raw `u64`: `AccountReader::get_balance` returns `AssetAmount`, `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_pswap_consume` takes `AssetAmount` fill amounts, and `tokens_to_base_units`/`base_units_to_tokens` parse to and display from `AssetAmount` (amounts above `AssetAmount::MAX` are now rejected at parse time with `TokenParseError::InvalidAmount`) ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [BREAKING][rename][cli] Renamed the `send` subcommand to `transfer` (behavior and flags unchanged) ([#2311](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2311)).
* [BREAKING][store] The SQLite store now stores account IDs as serialized `BLOB` columns instead of hex `TEXT` ([#2309](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2309)).
* [BREAKING][param][store] `Store::insert_block_header` now takes a `nodes` argument and persists the header with its MMR authentication nodes in a single transaction; the standalone `Store::insert_partial_blockchain_nodes` is removed. Header-only inserts (e.g. genesis) pass an empty slice ([#2294](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2294)).
* [BREAKING][rust] Removed `Client::fetch_all_private_notes`. The automatic per-tag backfill on sync replaces it, so callers no longer reset the cursor and re-fetch every tag after adding a tag or importing an account. ([#2258](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2258))
* [BREAKING][behavior][store] The `ConsumedExternal` note-metadata layout added in [#2308](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2308) is now the only supported serialized format. The backward-compatible decoding of the older metadata-less layout is removed, so existing stores are not compatible and must be recreated ([#2313](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2313)).

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Note screening (`Client::get_consumable_notes`, `Client::note_screener`) now memoizes transaction-input and vault (fee) witness lookups for the duration of a single screening pass. This only affects notes whose consumability cannot be determined statically, which are the ones screened by running a trial transaction: they no longer re-read the same account and reference-block data from the store for every note. Verdicts are still not retained between calls. The `get_consumable_notes` docs now also describe its cost and point to cheaper store-query alternatives ([#2326](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2326)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][rust] Historical private notes for a newly tracked tag are now backfilled automatically on sync. `Client::sync_note_transport` diffs the tracked note tags against a persisted covered set and drains each newly tracked tag from the start, fetching only that tag's own history rather than re-scanning every tag. ([#2258](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2258))

### Changes

* [rust] Re-exported new upstream types reachable from the public API: `ExpirationTransactionScript` and `SendNotesTransactionScriptError` from `miden_client::transaction`, `NoteSyncHint` from `miden_client::note`, `StorageValuePatch` and `StorageMapPatchEntries` from `miden_client::account`, and `FeeParameters` and `ValidatorKeys` from `miden_client::block`. ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][cli] `init` now reports a dedicated error when a configuration file already exists, hinting at `clear-config` instead of suggesting `init`, which the shared config-error hint did ([#2366](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2366)).
* [FIX][store] Opening a `SQLite` store now fingerprints the live database schema and compares it against the schema its migrations produce, rejecting a database whose schema has drifted (manual DDL, a partially applied migration, or corruption) instead of trusting a hash stored inside the database file ([#2304](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2304)).
* [FIX][rust] Notes received over the note transport layer now fetch attachments from the node via `get_notes_by_id`. Fetched attachment content is verified against the note metadata's attachments commitment; a note whose advertised attachment content the node cannot serve (or serves incorrectly) is skipped with a warning instead of failing the sync, and a note record is never stored with incomplete attachment content ([#2295](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2295)).
* [FIX][store] The SQLite store now honors `StorageMapPatch` create/remove semantics: a `Create` patch on an existing map slot clears the prior entries before writing (so its root reflects only the created entries) and a `Remove` patch drops the slot's entries and collapses its root to the empty-map root ([#2290](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2290)).
* [FIX][rust] Storing an authenticated block header now persists the header and its MMR authentication nodes in a single store transaction, so an interrupted write can no longer leave a tracked block without the MMR nodes needed to rebuild the `PartialMmr` ([#2294](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2294)).
* [FIX][rust] RPC endpoint parsing now rejects endpoint strings that omit either the protocol or host. ([#2266](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2266))
* [FIX][rust] State sync now re-verifies a tracked private account's commitment mismatch against the witness `get_account` returns. The witness is checked against the synced block's account root before locking the account, so a node can no longer durably lock it with a forged `sync_transactions` commitment ([#2260](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2260)).
* [FIX][rust] State sync now range-checks `sync_transactions` records to `(current, chain_tip]`, rejecting out-of-range records that could forge transaction commit heights ([#2252](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2252)).
* [FIX][rust] `Endpoint` parsing now strips a trailing slash from the host of no-port endpoints such as `http://host/`, matching the cleanup already applied when a port is present ([#2268](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2268)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_block_header_by_number` and `get_block_by_number` now reject responses whose block number does not match the requested one with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2270](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2270)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_notes_by_id` now rejects responses containing a note whose ID was not requested with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2283](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2283)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_nullifiers` now rejects responses containing a nullifier whose prefix was not requested with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2282](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2282)).
* [FIX][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_notes` now rejects responses containing a note whose tag was not requested with `RpcError::InvalidResponse` ([#2284](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2284)).
* [FIX][rust] Public account sync now binds `get_account` responses to the SyncMMR target block, rejecting snapshots from a different block, account, or account root ([#2255](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2255)).

## 0.15.5 (2026-08-03)

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][type][rust] `TransactionRequestError::InputNoteAlreadyConsumed` now carries a `NoteDetailsCommitment` instead of a `NoteId`, since a note record that was consumed externally may lack the metadata needed to derive its ID ([#2344](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2354)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][rust] An NTL delivery colliding with a note that a local transaction is consuming no longer wedges `sync_state()`: such deliveries are skipped (the store already holds their details) and the transport cursor advances past them ([#2353](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2353)).
* [FIX][rust] Transport deliveries are now validated on receipt — entries whose details don't match the header's details commitment or whose tag was never requested are dropped, with the cursor advancing past them ([#2353](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2353)).
* [FIX][rust] `Client::prepare_transaction` no longer panics when an input note is already consumed and its record carries no metadata; it returns `InputNoteAlreadyConsumed` instead ([#2344](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2354)).

## 0.15.4 (2026-07-16)

### Changes

* [rust] Bumped dependencies: Miden VM crates (`miden-core`, `miden-processor`, `miden-prover`, `miden-assembly`, etc.) to `0.23.5`, and `miden-node-proto-build` and `miden-remote-prover-client` to `0.15.1` ([#2301](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2301)).
* [cli] Documented the `call` command in the CLI docs ([#2317](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2317)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][rust] Added `is_inclusion_pending` to `InputNoteRecord` and `OutputNoteRecord` ([#2323](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2323)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][store] Add metadata to ConsumedExternal notes so that they can be findable by their `NoteId`. The change is store-compatible because records written by older clients (the metadata-less layout) still decode, reading back with no metadata as before ([#2308](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2308)).
* [FIX][rust,store] Output notes no longer register note tags, which leaked one row per created note; a store migration prunes the previously leaked tags ([#2323](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2323)).
* [FIX][rust] Public account sync now pins `get_account` to the sync target block (backport of [#2255](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2255)); an unpinned fetch could discard the client's own just-committed transaction as `Superseded`, permanently wedging the account.
* [FIX][rpc] Align `AddTransactionError` app-level codes with the node's `MempoolSubmissionError`, so submit-transaction failures report the correct cause (e.g. an account commitment mismatch is no longer misreported as "unauthenticated notes not found") and the node's message is preserved for state conflicts ([#2320](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2320)).

## 0.15.3 (2026-07-02)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][cli] `miden-cli call` now accepts advice map entries supplied via `--inputs-path/-i <FILE.toml>` in the same TOML format as `exec` ([#2244](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2244)).
* [FEATURE][rust] The gRPC client now accepts responses up to 15% above the node's 4 MiB payload budget by default, and `GrpcClient::with_max_decoding_message_size` lets callers raise the decode ceiling further. The CLI raises its own ceiling to 6 MiB to cover large `SyncTransactions` responses. This prevents syncs from failing with a "decoded message length too large" error when a node response slightly exceeds the previous hard 4 MiB limit ([#2299](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2299)).

## 0.15.2 (2026-06-18)

### Features

* [FEATURE][rust] Added PSWAP chain tracking: the client now follows a local creator's partial-swap order across foreign partial fills during sync, surfacing each reconstructed payback as a consumable input note and letting the creator reclaim the current tip. New `Client` API: `pswap_lineages`, `pswap_lineages_for`, `pswap_active_lineages`, `pswap_lineage`, and `build_pswap_cancel_by_order` ([#2231](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2231)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::send_private_note_with_block_hint`, which relays a sender-provided `after_block_num` so recipients get deterministic delivery instead of relying on receiving side lookback. ([#2262](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2262))

### Changes

* [rust] Bumped `miden-note-transport-proto-build` to `0.4.1`. Notes imported from the note transport layer now use the provided `after_block_num` when present, falling back to the 20-block lookback window otherwise. `NoteInfo` gained a `block_hint: Option<BlockNumber>` field (plus a `NoteInfo::new` constructor) and `NoteTransportClient` gained a `send_note_with_block_hint` method (defaulting to `send_note`, so existing implementors keep compiling).  ([#2262](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2262))

## 0.15.1 (2026-06-16)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Re-exported `miden-agglayer` as `miden_client::agglayer`. ([#2253](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2253))

## 0.15.0 (2026-06-12)

### Fixes

* [FIX][rust] `Client::execute_transaction` no longer writes to the store before execution: the request's input notes and output note scripts are persisted only after the transaction executes successfully and is applied, so a failed execution leaves the store unchanged ([#2222](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2222)).
* [FIX][rust] `Client::send_private_note` is now durable across transient NTL failures: the relay payload is persisted to a durable outbox (a `Vec<NoteInfo>` under the `note_transport_outbox` settings key) before the transport call, so a failed or interrupted `send_note` no longer drops the note. `Client::sync_note_transport` retries the outbox on each sync (the receiver dedupes by note id) and a failing relay no longer blocks the sync; the new `Client::flush_relay_outbox()` lets callers drive retries directly ([#2127](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2127)).
* [FIX] Fixed `derive_account_commitments` to return the final account commitment when multiple transactions for the same account are committed in the same block ([#2164](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2164)).
* [FIX] Stopped state sync from aborting when the node reports a stale (non-monotonic) header for a rapidly-advancing account: such updates are now skipped instead of failing with a nonce error ([#2216](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2216)).
* [FIX] Preserve a fungible asset's callback flag when the store replays a vault delta, fixing a `ConflictingRoots` error when consuming callback-bearing (e.g. agglayer-minted) assets ([#2225](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2225)).
* [FIX] Fixed the `sync_notes_with_details` to fetch the attachments for private notes ([#2214](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2214)).
* [rust] Expanded validation for output notes before executing a `TransactionRequest`. ([#89](https://github.com/0xMiden/wallet-adapter/issues/89))
* [FIX][rust] `Client::fetch_all_private_notes` now drains the full backlog across multiple server-paginated responses instead of returning after a single batch. Needed once the note-transport server (`0xMiden/note-transport-service#77`) caps each `fetch_notes` response at `FETCH_NOTES_BATCH_SIZE` rows — previously the function silently returned only the first batch, contradicting its documented "fetches all notes" semantics. Companion deterministic regression test (`fetch_all_private_notes_drains_across_batches`) uses a new `MockNoteTransportNode::with_max_batch(n)` constructor to exercise multi-batch drain. ([#2095](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2095))
* [FIX][rust] Fixed the `dap` feature build by bumping `miden-debug`/`miden-debug-engine` to 0.8.1 and `miden-core` to 0.23.2, aligning the debugger crates with the `miden-core` APIs they call. ([#2189](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2189))

### Changes

* [BREAKING][rust] Added a `Subscription(Word)` variant to `NoteTagSource`. ([#2248](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2248))
* [rust] Added `Store::apply_settings_mutations` for batched `settings` writes. ([#2248](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2248))
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_block_by_number()` now takes an `include_proof: bool` parameter to control whether the block proof is included in the response. ([#1991](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1991))
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_chain_mmr()` replaced `block_to: Option<BlockNumber>` with `upper_bound: SyncTarget` to match the RPC definition. Use `SyncTarget::CommittedChainTip` for previous default behavior (`None`), or `SyncTarget::BlockNumber(num)` for a specific block number. ([#1991](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1991))
* [BREAKING][rust] Added `submit_proven_batch` to `NodeRpcClient` trait. ([#2075](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2075))
* [BREAKING][param][cli] `address add` now takes `<ACCOUNT_ID> <BECH32_ADDRESS>` instead of `<ACCOUNT_ID> <INTERFACE> [TAG_LEN]`. Use the new `address encode` subcommand to build a bech32 string from `<ACCOUNT_ID> <INTERFACE> [TAG_LEN]`. ([#2115](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2115))
* [BREAKING][rust] `StateSync` no longer takes an `Option<Arc<dyn Store>>`. `StateSyncInput::accounts` is now a `Vec<AccountSyncHint>` (header + `AccountStorageHeader`); when hints cover the account's map slots `StateSync` issues a single `get_account_proof` for non-oversized accounts, and when new map slots appear on-chain it only fetches the missing ones. The `Store` trait method `get_account_map_slot_names` was replaced with `get_account_storage_header`. ([#2132](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2132))
* [BREAKING] `NodeRpcClient::get_account_details` now fetches a public account's storage maps in a single `/GetAccount` request and returns `Option<Account>`. No longer returns data for private accounts; instead use `NodeRpcClient::get_account` to fetch private account's commitment. ([#2215](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2215)).
* [BREAKING] Removed the account storage-layout sync hints; `StateSyncInput::accounts` now takes a `Vec<AccountHeader>` ([#2215](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2215)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `BasicFungibleFaucet` is now a unit struct; token symbol/decimals/max-supply moved to a new `FungibleTokenMetadata` component built via `FungibleTokenMetadata::builder`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][behavior][cli] `account new-faucet` now requires a `[fungible-faucet-metadata]` block (typed `symbol`, `decimals`, `max_supply`, optional `name`) in the init data file passed via `-i`, replacing the previous `["miden::standards::fungible_faucets::metadata"]` section with stringly-typed values. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][behavior][all] Note scripts must now use the package-style header `@note_script` + `pub proc main … end` instead of the bare `begin … end`, following the upstream protocol bump. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][type][rust] Token-policy components in `account::component` were redesigned: removed `MintAuthControlled`, `MintOwnerControlled`, `BurnAuthControlled`, `BurnOwnerControlled` (and their `*Config` variants); faucets now install a single `TokenPolicyManager` configured with `PolicyAuthority` + `MintPolicyConfig` / `BurnPolicyConfig`, plus standalone `MintAllowAll` / `MintOwnerOnly` / `BurnAllowAll` / `BurnOwnerOnly` policy components. Construct via `AccountBuilder::with_components(TokenPolicyManager::new(...))`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `NoteScript::root()` now returns `NoteScriptRoot` instead of `Word`. Use `Word::from(root)` (or `root.into()`) where a `Word` is required. `NoteScriptRoot` is re-exported from `miden_client::note`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][rename][rust] `FeeParameters::native_asset_id()` renamed to `fee_faucet_id()`. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][rust] Removed `NodeRpcClient::check_nullifiers`, `RpcEndpoint::CheckNullifiers`, `EndpointError::CheckNullifiers`, and `CheckNullifiersError` after the upstream node dropped the `CheckNullifiers` gRPC method. Use `NodeRpcClient::sync_nullifiers` to retrieve nullifier updates. ([#2145](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2145))
* [BREAKING][behavior][cli] `token_symbol_map.toml` requires the `id` field to be a bech32 address; hex `AccountId`s are no longer accepted. Convert existing entries by copying the bech32 address from `account list`. ([#2159](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2159))
* Added a `Client::import_watched_account_by_id` method to track an external account state without syncing notes ([#2143](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2143)).
* Removed limit on accounts and note tags that can be tracked by the client ([#2170](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2170)).
* [BREAKING] Updated the `sync_notes` and `sync_transactions` to return directly the fetched updates. Removed `TransactionsInfo` and `NoteSyncInfo` structs ([#2170](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2170)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust,store] `InputNoteRecord::new` takes a `NoteAttachments` argument; input notes persist attachments (new `attachments` column on `input_notes`) ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `build_wallet_id` dropped its trailing `is_mutable: bool` (code mutability isn't encoded in the account ID) ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203)).
* [BREAKING][behavior][cli] `new-account`/`new-wallet` `--account-type` (`-t`) now accepts only `private`/`public`; legacy faucet/mutability values and `--mutable` are removed. Faucet-vs-regular is derived from packages — a `FungibleFaucet` component yields a fungible faucet with an implicit `TokenPolicyManager` ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203)).
* [BREAKING][type][rust] `Client::import_notes` returns `Vec<NoteDetailsCommitment>` (was `Vec<NoteId>`), since metadata-less imports have no `NoteId` yet — resolve via `Client::get_input_note_by_commitment` ([#2203](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2203), [#2235](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2235)).
* [BREAKING] Reworked the `GetAccount` surface on `NodeRpcClient`: replaced `get_account_proof` with `get_account(account_id, GetAccountRequest)` and added `resolve_oversize_vault` / `resolve_oversize_storage_maps` helpers. `GetAccountRequest` bundles the previous positional args ([#2202](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2202)).
* [BREAKING][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_note_script_by_root` now returns `Option<NoteScript>` (`None` when the node has no script for the requested root) instead of erroring when the script is absent ([#1840](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1840)).
* [BREAKING] `miden_client::note` re-exports updated to match the protocol's split of attachment data off `NoteMetadata`: removed `NoteAttachmentKind` and `NoteMetadataHeader`, added `NoteAttachmentHeader`, `NoteAttachments`, and `PartialNoteMetadata`. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] `CommittedNoteMetadata` simplified to a single `Full(NoteMetadata)` variant; the `Header { sender, note_type, tag, attachment_kind }` variant is removed because sync responses now always carry full metadata (attachment content is still fetched separately via `GetNotesById`, but is no longer part of `NoteMetadata`). Callers no longer need to handle the header-only case. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_pswap_create` now takes `note_attachment: Option<NoteAttachment>` instead of `NoteAttachment`. Pass `None` when there is nothing to attach (previously `NoteAttachment::default()`). ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] `account list`, `account show`, and `account new-faucet` now read and build the new `FungibleFaucet` component (multi-slot) instead of the standalone `TokenMetadata` storage item. Faucet accounts created with the previous component layout are no longer recognized; new faucets are constructed via `FungibleFaucet::builder` rather than the `basic-fungible-faucet` package. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING] Note attachments are no longer carried on the note-transport wire format (only `NoteHeader` + serialized `NoteDetails`). ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* [BREAKING][rust] Removed the top-level `miden_client::standards` alias. Use the curated client paths as before, or the new raw upstream namespaces `miden_client::account::standards::*`, `miden_client::note::standards::*`, and `miden_client::testing::standards::*`. ([#2185](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2185))
* Added a blanket implementation for `NodeRpcClient::get_account_details` ([#2196](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2196)).
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_storage_maps` and `NodeRpcClient::sync_account_vault` now take a required `block_to: BlockNumber` instead of `Option<BlockNumber>`. The node rejects ranges that extend beyond the chain tip, so callers must pass an explicit upper bound (e.g. the client's sync height). ([#2229](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2229))
* Replaced `node-builder` crate with a leaner `test-node-genesis` crate and removed the `testing-remote-prover` crate; the testing node now runs the node's own `miden-remote-prover` ([#2232](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2232)).

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Added `Client::sync_chain()` (on-chain sync only) and `Client::sync_note_transport()` (Note Transport Layer fetch only) for callers needing finer-grained control over sync. ([#2091](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2091))
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `GrpcClient::with_bearer_auth(token)` to attach an `authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every outbound gRPC call, for use behind authenticating gateways. Tokens are validated at connection time and preserved across `set_genesis_commitment` updates ([#2101](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2101)).
* Made new-account construction use merged storage schema commitment (`build_with_schema_commitment`), re-exported `AccountBuilderSchemaCommitmentExt`, added WASM `buildWithoutSchemaCommitment()`, and fixed contract `accounts.create()` to require explicit `components` ([#1996](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1996)).
* Fixed the faucet token symbol display when showing account details ([#1985](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1985) ([#2158](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2158))).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli,web] Added `get_network_note_status` to `NodeRpcClient` trait for querying the processing status of notes submitted to the network (pending, nullifier-inflight, discarded, nullifier-committed), along with attempt count and error details. Exposed as `miden-client network-note-status <note_id>` CLI command and `RpcClient.getNetworkNoteStatus()` in the web client. ([#1981](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1981))
* Remove MMR peaks from the blocks table and store them alongside the sync height in a new `blockchain_checkpoint` table ([#2100](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2100)).
* Added `miden-cli call` command for invoking account procedures directly from the CLI ([#1943](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1943)).
* [FEATURE][rust,store] Added `BatchBuilder` for stacking multiple transactions against multiple local accounts and submitting them as one proven batch via `SubmitProvenBatch`. Also adds `Store::apply_transaction_batch` (atomic multi-tx apply) with a `SqliteStore` implementation. ([#2109](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2109), [#2160](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2160))
* Made `TransactionStoreUpdate` serialization lossless ([#2112](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2112)).
* [FEATURE][cli] Added `address encode <ACCOUNT_ID> <INTERFACE> [TAG_LEN]` subcommand that prints the bech32 encoding of an address built from the given fields (useful for producing the input to `address add`). ([#2115](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2115))
* [FEATURE][cli] On asset display, the CLI now lazily fetches on-chain `TokenMetadata` for untracked public faucets via RPC and persists the result in the client's settings store. ([#2159](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2159))
* [FEATURE][cli] Faucet/account IDs in human-facing CLI output (account list, `notes -s`, transaction summaries) are now rendered as bech32 addresses using the configured network instead of hex IDs. Hex remains in error messages and debug output. ([#2159](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2159))
* Added an integration test for network-transaction public output note creation ([#2073](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2073)).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli] Added DAP-backed transaction execution support through `DapProgramExecutor`/`ProgramExecutor`, and made `miden-client exec --start-debug-adapter` compile source scripts so DAP clients can resolve source locations. ([#2189](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2189), [#2245](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2245))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `StorageView` JS wrapper over WASM `AccountStorage`. `account.storage()` now returns a `StorageView` that makes `getItem()` work intuitively for both Value and StorageMap slots. WASM primitives are unchanged; the raw `AccountStorage` is accessible via `.raw` ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1955)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `wordToBigInt()` utility export for losslessly converting a `Word`'s first felt to a `BigInt`. `StorageResult.toString()` is BigInt-backed, and `valueOf()` returns a JS number for values fitting in `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and throws `RangeError` for larger u64 values — use `.toBigInt()` for exact access ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1955)).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli] Added partial swap (PSWAP) support: `TransactionRequestBuilder::build_pswap_create` / `build_pswap_consume` / `build_pswap_cancel` and a `miden-client pswap` CLI command (`create`, `consume`, `cancel`) for partially-fillable fungible swaps ([#2162](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2162)).
* Added verification of MMR responses during state sync: validated the returned block range matches the requested range and checked that post-delta MMR peaks match the block header's chain commitment ([#1887](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1887)).

## 0.14.9 (2026-05-19)

### Enhancements

* Bumped `miden-vm` workspace dependencies from 0.22.1 to 0.22.4.

## 0.14.7 (2026-06-05)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][rust] Added `GrpcClient::with_bearer_auth(token)` to attach an `authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every outbound gRPC call, for use behind authenticating gateways. Tokens are validated at connection time and preserved across `set_genesis_commitment` updates ([#2101](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2101)).

## 0.14.6 (2026-05-05)

### Fixes

* [FIX] When the client submits a network note and it is also tracking the recipient network account, now the `InputNoteReader` detects the consumed note ([#2113](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2113)).
* Changed note transport integration tests to validate note ids and avoid matching with existing notes when running against testnet ([#2148](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2148)).

## 0.14.5 (2026-04-27)

### Breaking Changes

* [BREAKING][behavior][rust,web] `CodeBuilder::compile_note_script` now expects a library module with a single procedure annotated `@note_script` (e.g. `@note_script\npub proc main\n    ...\nend`) instead of a `begin..end` program. Inherited from `miden-standards` 0.14.5, which switched the underlying call from `assemble_program` to `assemble_library` ([#2128](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2128)).

### Enhancements

* Added `ClientBuilder::source_manager()` to override the `SourceManager` used by the client. When not set, the client defaults to `DefaultSourceManager`. Set this when compiling scripts outside the client with an external `Assembler`, so source spans resolve against the same manager ([#2047](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2047)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Stopped the wasm-bindgen-generated array constructors (`NoteArray`, `OutputNoteArray`, `NoteAndArgsArray`, `NoteRecipientArray`, `StorageSlotArray`, `TransactionScriptInputPairArray`, `FeltArray`, `AccountIdArray`, `AccountArray`, `ForeignAccountArray`, `NoteIdAndArgsArray`) from silently moving each input element's underlying Rust value out of the caller's JS handle. The default `pub fn new(elements: Option<Vec<T>>)` path took every element by value via wasm-bindgen's `Vec<T>` ABI: the JS handle's `__wbg_ptr` was left unchanged so the object looked fine, but any subsequent method on it panicked inside WASM with the opaque `"null pointer passed to rust"` error. The auto-generated array exports are now overridden in `js/index.js` with thin wrappers that build the same array via `push(&T)` (which already borrows + clones) so callers can keep using the originals after construction. Same pattern applied to `replaceAt` on the Rust side, which now takes `elem: &T` instead of `elem: T`. Repro: `const note = new Note(...); new NoteArray([note]); note.id();` — used to panic, now succeeds.
* [FIX][rust] Fixed source manager mismatch panic (`invalid source span: starting byte is out of bounds`) in tests that compiled scripts with a standalone `SourceManager` and then executed them through the client. Test helpers now use `TransactionKernel::assembler_with_source_manager()` and the client's shared source manager ([#2047](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2047)).
* [FIX][react] Fixed `initializeSignerAccount` (the external-keystore init path used by `MidenFiSignerProvider`, Para, Turnkey, etc.) throwing `"invalid enum value passed"` on first connect. The code reached for `AuthScheme.AuthEcdsaK256Keccak`, which only exists on the internal wasm-bindgen `AuthScheme` enum, not on the public string-valued `AuthScheme` constant exported from `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/lazy` — at runtime it resolved to `undefined`, and passing `undefined` to `AccountComponent.createAuthComponentFromCommitment` failed at the wasm boundary. `initializeSignerAccount` now calls `resolveAuthScheme(AuthScheme.ECDSA)`, where `resolveAuthScheme` is a newly-public helper from `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` that converts the string constants to the numeric wasm-bindgen variant.
* [FIX][react] `DEFAULTS.AUTH_SCHEME` was being initialized to `AuthScheme.AuthRpoFalcon512` — another nonexistent key on the public `AuthScheme`, silently resolving to `undefined`. Now set to `AuthScheme.Falcon`. The four hooks that read this default (`useCreateWallet`, `useCreateFaucet`, `useImportAccount`, `useSessionAccount`) now pipe the value through `resolveAuthScheme(...)` before handing it to the wasm-bindgen `newWallet` / `newFaucet` / `importPublicAccountFromSeed` calls. The public hook option types stay `authScheme?: AuthScheme`, which now correctly means `"falcon" | "ecdsa"`.

## 0.14.4 (2026-04-20)

### Features

* Added DAP-backed transaction script debugging support with `--start-debug-adapter` flag on the `exec` CLI command, `execute_program_with_dap` client method, and offline bootstrap mode for node-less execution ([#1959](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1959)).
* [FEATURE][web] Serialize all async `WebClient` JS methods — both the explicit wrappers and every async call that falls through `createClientProxy` to the underlying WASM client (e.g. `getAccount`, `importAccountById`, `getAccountStorage`) — via an internal `_serializeWasmCall` chain. Prevents `"recursive use of an object detected"` panics when an unwrapped read/write races the auto-sync timer or any explicitly-wrapped method. Expose `waitForIdle()` on `MidenClient` so callers can drain in-flight work before mutating non-WASM state ([#2057](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2057)).
* [FEATURE][web] Split `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` into eager and lazy entry points. The default entry (`import from "@miden-sdk/miden-sdk"`) now awaits WASM at module top level via a small shim (`js/eager.js`) — consumers don't need `await MidenClient.ready()` / `isReady` before constructing wasm-bindgen types. The lazy entry (`import from "@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/lazy"`) preserves the previous behavior and is required for Capacitor WKWebView hosts (the custom-scheme handler hangs on TLA) and Next.js SSR. Verified empirically against the Miden Wallet's iOS E2E suite on devnet. `@miden-sdk/react` imports from `/lazy` internally and manages readiness via `isReady`.
* [FEATURE][web] Expose `lastAuthError()` on `MidenClient` for typed sign-callback failure recovery — preserves the raw thrown value from the JS signCallback so consumers can distinguish locked/rejected/IO-error failure modes ([#2058](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2058)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `"custom"` operation to `preview()` so users can dry-run any pre-built `TransactionRequest`, not just send/mint/consume/swap ([#2052](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2052)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `BlockHeader.nativeAssetId()` so JavaScript consumers can read the native fungible-faucet account ID from a block header. The field already rides the RPC wire and is decoded into the Rust `BlockHeader`, but no WASM accessor existed, forcing wallets and dApps to hardcode the native faucet per network ([#2070](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2070)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] `proveTransactionWithProver` now takes `&TransactionProver` by reference instead of consuming by value — the old signature invalidated the JS handle after one use, silently falling back to local proving on subsequent calls ([#2062](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2062)).

## 0.14.3 (2026-04-16)

### Fixes

* [FIX] Detect notes created and consumed on the same block that got erased from the node and mark them as consumed ([#2008](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2008)).

## 0.14.2 (2026-04-15)

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] Added `compile.noteScript({ code, libraries? })` to `MidenClient`, filling the gap left on the resource-based surface for note-script compilation. Mirrors the existing `compile.txScript` shape ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2044)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exported the `CompilerResource` class so framework wrappers (e.g. React hooks) can instantiate the compile surface over a `WasmWebClient` proxy without wrapping the full `MidenClient`. The third constructor argument is now optional ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2044)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` deterministically failing with `mmr peaks are invalid: number of one bits in leaves is N which does not equal peak length M` after importing a private note whose inclusion block pre-dates the wallet's current sync height. `get_and_store_authenticated_block` was overwriting the correct historical peaks (written by `applyStateSync`) with peaks from the caller's current `PartialMmr` forest, so subsequent reads at the same block hit the `InvalidPeaks` validation. The IndexedDB `insertBlockHeader` now uses add-if-not-exists semantics, matching the SQLite store's `INSERT OR IGNORE` in `insert_block_header_tx` ([#2039](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2039)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed WASM worker loading under webpack 5 / Next.js consumers. v0.14.1's single classic worker rewrote `import.meta.url` → `self.location.href` (needed for Safari/WKWebView cold-start performance), which webpack's asset tracer cannot follow — consumers hit a 404 on `miden_client_web.wasm` and the SDK silently fell back to a main-thread mode that hung on `sync()`. The SDK now ships BOTH variants (`web-client-methods-worker.js` classic for Safari, `web-client-methods-worker.module.js` ES module for webpack/Vite/Parcel) and `WebClient` picks at runtime via UA detection, configurable via the new `WebClient.workerMode` (`"auto"` / `"module"` / `"classic"`) static. No consumer config changes needed for auto ([#2046](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2046)).

## 0.14.1 (2026-04-14)

### Enhancements

* Optimized `get_account_details` so it only fetches the delta of large public accounts when syncing ([#1916](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1916)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` failure ("inconsistent partial mmr: tracked leaf at position N has no value in nodes") caused by skipping authentication node collection for blocks already tracked from the MMR delta during large catch-up syncs. Authentication nodes are now always collected for note-relevant blocks regardless of prior tracking state. ([#1997](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1997)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `transactions.send({ returnNote: true })` throwing `expected instance of NoteArray`. The JS wrapper was still building `OutputNoteArray` after the WASM binding for `withOwnOutputNotes` switched to `NoteArray` ([#2011](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/2011)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed `FilesystemKeyStore::add_key` failing on Linux when the system temp dir is on a different filesystem than the keys directory ([#2009](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2009)).
* [FIX][rust] Made source manager handling consistent when building transaction scripts. The empty fallback script is now compiled against the client's source manager instead of a fresh one, so any source information on the produced `TransactionScript` is registered with the same source manager used by the executor ([#2006](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/2006)).

## 0.14.0 (2026-04-07)

### Enhancements

* Made `GrpcNoteTransportClient` connection lazy, deferring it to the first RPC call instead of connecting eagerly at client initialization ([#1970](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1970)).
* Updated the `GrpcClient` to fetch the RPC limits from the node ([#1724](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1724)) ([#1737](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1737), [#1809](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1809)).
* Added typed error parsing for node RPC endpoints, enabling programmatic error handling instead of string parsing ([#1734](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1734)).
* Added `--rpc-status` flag to `miden-client info` command to display RPC node status information including node version, genesis commitment, store status, and block producer status; also added `get_status_unversioned` to `NodeRpcClient` trait ([#1742](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1742)).
* Prevent a potential unwrap panic in `insert_storage_map_nodes_for_map` ([#1750](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1750)).
* Changed the `StateSync::sync_state()` to take a reference of the MMR ([#1764](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1764)).
* Account storage restructured into latest/historical tables for efficient delta writes and simpler pruning ([#1775](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1775)).
* Remove unnecessary clones of `NoteInclusionProof` and `NoteMetadata` in note import and sync paths ([#1787](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1787)).
* [FEATURE][web] WebClient now automatically syncs state before account creation when the client has never been synced, preventing a slow full-chain scan on the next sync (#1704).
* Added `NoteScreener` constructor via `Client::note_screener()` and improved note consumability checks with batch note screening support ([#1803](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1803), [#1814](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1814)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `getAccountProof` method to the web client's `RpcClient`, allowing lightweight retrieval of account header, storage slot values, and code via a single RPC call. Refactored the `NodeRpcClient::get_account_proof` signature to allow requesting just private account proofs ([#1794](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1794), [#1814](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1814)).
* Added `getAccountByKeyCommitment` method to `WebClient` for retrieving accounts by public key commitment ([#1729](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1729)).
* [BREAKING][removal][web] Removed `addAccountSecretKeyToWebStore`, `getAccountAuthByPubKeyCommitment`, `getPublicKeyCommitmentsOfAccount`, and `getAccountByKeyCommitment` from `WebClient`. Use the new `client.keystore` sub-object instead (e.g. `client.keystore.insert()`, `client.keystore.get()`, `client.keystore.getCommitments()`, `client.keystore.getAccountId()` + `client.getAccount()`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1947)).
* Added automatic registration of note scripts required by network transactions (NTX): the client checks the node's script registry before submitting and registers any missing scripts. Standard note scripts are skipped since the NTX builder resolves them directly ([#1840](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1840)).
* Added automatic retry for rate-limited (`ResourceExhausted`) and transiently unavailable RPC calls in `GrpcClient`, with up to 5 attempts and `retry-after` header support ([#1928](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1928)).
* Added client methods to prune account history (commitments of previous nonces, alongside its orphaned account code) ([#1886](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1886)).
* Changed the sync state to track the consumer account on externally-consumed notes, so the `InputNoteReader` can return notes even if the transaction was not locally executed ([#1973](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1973)).

### Changes

* [BREAKING] Incremented MSRV to 1.91 ([#1798](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1798)).
* [BREAKING] Replaced `AuthFalcon512Rpo`/`AuthEcdsaK256Keccak` with unified  `AuthSingleSig`, changed `StorageMapKey` from a type alias to a newtype, renamed note constructors to associated methods (`P2idNote::create`, `SwapNote::create`, `P2ideNote::create`), and started requiring `AccountComponentMetadata` in `AccountComponent::new`([#1798](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1798)).
* Included Partial states in `NoteFilter::Unspent` for output notes ([#1817](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1817)).
* [BREAKING][arch][web] Replaced the `WebClient` class with a new `MidenClient` resource-based API as the primary web SDK entry point. `WebClient` is still available as `WasmWebClient` for low-level access but is no longer part of the public API. All documentation has been updated to use `MidenClient`. Migration: replace `WebClient.createClient(rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName)` with `MidenClient.create({ rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName })`, and replace direct method calls (e.g. `client.newWallet(...)`, `client.submitNewTransaction(...)`, `client.getAccounts()`) with resource methods (e.g. `client.accounts.create()`, `client.transactions.send(...)`, `client.accounts.list()`). ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AccountId.fromHex()` now returns `Result` (throws on invalid hex) instead of silently panicking via `unwrap()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING] Added a `AccountReader` accessible through `Client::account_reader` to read account data without needing to load the whole `Account` ([#1713](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1713), [#1716](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1716)).
* [BREAKING] Added `Keystore` trait that extends `TransactionAuthenticator` to provide a unified interface for key storage, retrieval, and account-key mapping, enabling custom keystore implementations. `Keystore` replaces `TransactionAuthenticator` in `Client` and provides a way to map from account IDs to public keys (registering them separately is not required anymore). ([#1726](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1726)).
* Refactored integration tests binary with subprocess-per-test execution; added automatic retry of failed tests (`--retry-count`), captured stdout/stderr per test, and tracing support via `RUST_LOG` ([#1743](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1743)).
* Improved integration test logging with a `--verbose` flag for info-level tracing, routed tracing output to stderr to avoid corrupting subprocess JSON, and added `tracing::info!` instrumentation to test helpers ([#1816](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1816)).
* Added implementation for the `get_public_key` method on the `FilesystemKeystore` and `WebKeystore` ([#1731](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1731)).
* [BREAKING] Made the nullifiers sync optional on the `StateSync` component ([#1756](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1756)).
* Decoupled keystore functionality from `WebStore` by moving keystore helper logic from `idxdb-store` into the `web-client` crate, also added `export_store` and `import_store` methods to the `Store` trait, enabling usage of different stores ([#1795](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1795)).
* [BREAKING] Added `SyncStateInputs` to bundle the parameters needed to perform the sync state ([#1778](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1778)).
* Added lazy loading for foreign accounts. Specifying `TransactionRequestBuilder::foreign_accounts()` for public accounts is no longer required ([#1812](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1812), [#1892](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1892)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AuthSecretKey.getRpoFalcon512SecretKeyAsFelts()` and `getEcdsaK256KeccakSecretKeyAsFelts()` now return `Result<Vec<Felt>, JsValue>` instead of panicking on key type mismatch ([#1833](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1833)).
* [BREAKING][rename][cli] Renamed `CliConfig::from_system()` to `CliConfig::load()` and `CliClient::from_system_user_config()` to `CliClient::new()` for better discoverability ([#1848](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1848)).
* Removed `SmtForest` empty-root workaround in `AccountSmtForest::safe_pop_smts`, now that the upstream fix has landed in miden-crypto v0.19.7 ([#1864](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1864)).
* [BREAKING][rename][all] Adapted to upstream protocol renames: `Falcon512Rpo` renamed to `Falcon512Poseidon2`, `Felt::as_int()` renamed to `as_canonical_u64()`, `OutputNote::Full` replaced by `OutputNote::Public(PublicOutputNote)`, Asset now uses key-value words API.
* [BREAKING][rename][all] Adapted to upstream protocol 0.14.0 renames: `NoteHeader::commitment()` renamed to `to_commitment()`, `NoteLocation::node_index_in_block()` renamed to `block_note_tree_index()`, `StorageMapKey::inner()` removed (use `Word::from(key)`), `TransactionOutputs::expiration_block_num` field now private (use getter). ([#1926](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1926))
* Added an `InputNoteReader` accessible through `client.input_note_reader()` that allows for lazy iterator over all the consumed input notes ([#1843](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1843), ([#1925](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1925))).
* Removed miden-cli template TOMLs in favor of direct serialization into packages ([#1879](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1879)).
* [BREAKING] Updated `SyncState` to fetch multiple note updates ([#1941](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1941), [#1963](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1963)).
* Unified test environment variables across Rust and web client test suites. `TEST_MIDEN_NETWORK` now acts as a preset that configures all components (RPC, prover, note transport) for `devnet`/`testnet`/`localhost`. Individual env vars (`TEST_MIDEN_RPC_URL`, `TEST_MIDEN_PROVER_URL`, `TEST_MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_URL`) override specific components. Removed `TEST_MIDEN_RPC_ENDPOINT`, `TEST_WITH_NOTE_TRANSPORT`, `TEST_MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT`, and `REMOTE_PROVER` ([#1939](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1939)).
* [BREAKING] Updated miden-node crates to v0.14.3 and adapted to upstream package-related changes: `MastArtifact` and `PackageKind` removed, `Package::mast` is now `Arc<Library>`, `PackageManifest::new()` returns `Result`, `assemble_library()` returns `Arc<Library>`([#1972](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1972)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] New `MidenClient` class with resource-based API (`client.accounts`, `client.transactions`, `client.notes`, `client.tags`, `client.settings`). Provides high-level transaction helpers (`send`, `mint`, `consume`, `swap`, `consumeAll`), transaction dry-runs via `preview()`, confirmation polling via `waitFor()`, and flexible account/note references that accept hex strings, bech32 strings, or WASM objects interchangeably (`AccountRef`, `NoteInput` types). Factory methods: `MidenClient.create()`, `MidenClient.createTestnet()`, `MidenClient.createMock()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionId.fromHex()` static constructor for creating transaction IDs from hex strings. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added standalone tree-shakeable note utilities (`createP2IDNote`, `createP2IDENote`, `buildSwapTag`) usable without a client instance. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] SDK ergonomics: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, `accounts.import()` accepts full `AccountRef`, `transactions.send()` return type changed to `SendResult` with optional `returnNote`, notes API simplified (`listAvailable` returns `InputNoteRecord[]`, `consume` accepts `Note` objects), `MidenClient.create()` accepts rpcUrl/proverUrl shorthands.
* [BREAKING][FEATURE][web] Custom contract support: `accounts.create()` with `ImmutableContract`/`MutableContract` types, new `client.compile` resource (`compile.component()`, `compile.txScript()` with `"dynamic"`/`"static"` linking), and `transactions.execute({ account, script, foreignAccounts? })` for custom script execution with FPI. `transactions.send()` return type changed. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Account import improvements: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, and `accounts.import()` now accepts full `AccountRef` (string, `AccountId`, `Account`, `AccountHeader`) in addition to `{ file }` and `{ seed }` forms. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `AccountId.fromPrefixSuffix(prefix, suffix)` constructor for building an `AccountId` from its two felt components, useful when prefix/suffix are stored separately in storage maps. ([#1889](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1889))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionRequestBuilder.withExpirationDelta()` for expiring manual transaction requests ([#1904](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1904))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `accounts.insert({ account, overwrite? })` to `MidenClient` for inserting pre-built `Account` objects into the local store. Enables external signer integrations that build accounts via `AccountBuilder` with custom auth commitments ([#1922](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1922)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `executeProgram` (view call) to the JS side, allowing local execution of a transaction script against an account and inspection of the 16-element stack output without submitting to the network. Added `AdviceInputs` constructor and reverse `From` conversions. ([#1859](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/issues/1859))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `client.keystore` sub-object API for managing secret keys. Methods: `insert(accountId, secretKey)`, `get(pubKeyCommitment)`, `remove(pubKeyCommitment)`, `getCommitments(accountId)`, `getAccountId(pubKeyCommitment)`. Also available on `MidenClient` as a resource (`client.keystore`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1947))

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Replaced `.unwrap()` panics with proper `Result` returns in `MerklePath.computeRoot()`, `NoteExecutionHint.fromParts()`, `NoteExecutionHint.canBeConsumed()`, `NoteStorage` constructor, and `TransactionStatus.discarded()` WASM bindings ([#1870](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1870)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed `get_vault_asset_witnesses` failing with `MerkleError::RootNotInStore` when the vault root is missing from the `AccountSmtForest`. The error is now caught and falls back to loading the full vault from the store ([#1890](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1890)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed the error `TypeError: parameter 1 is not of type 'ArrayBuffer'` when re-initializing a client with an imported database. `Uint8Array` fields (e.g. the client version setting) were exported as plain arrays and not restored to `Uint8Array` on import, causing `TextDecoder.decode()` to fail. Export now tags `Uint8Array` values for correct round-trip. ([#1952](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1952))
* [FIX][rust] Replaced `.expect()` panics on RPC response data with proper error propagation ([#1833](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1833)).

## 0.13.4 (2026-03-23)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed storage map slots with duplicate roots losing their entries after a store round-trip, which corrupted the storage commitment ([#1915](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1915)).
* [FIX][all] Fixed private notes delivered via NTL getting stuck as `Expected` when syncing at high frequency (e.g. every 3s). The on-chain commitment could be processed before the NTL delivered the note data, causing the note to never transition to `Committed`. The note import flow now scans back up to 20 blocks from the current sync height when checking for committed notes, so notes committed just before the client synced past them are found during import.

## 0.13.3 (2026-03-16)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed `sync_state()` invoking the external signer (e.g. wallet extension) during note consumability checks, causing repeated confirmation popups on every sync cycle. `NoteScreener` no longer attaches the `TransactionAuthenticator` when trial-executing consume transactions; accounts requiring auth now return `ConsumableWithAuthorization` instead ([#1905](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1905)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed redundant `/GetAccount` RPC calls during `sync_state()` — a public account active across N sync steps now triggers exactly 1 fetch instead of N ([#1876](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1876)).
* [FIX] Deduplicated storage map entries returned by the `SyncAccountStorageMaps` RPC endpoint, keeping only the latest value per key. Previously, accounts with storage map keys updated across multiple blocks would fail to load ([#1902](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1902)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `PrematureCommitError` crash during `syncState()` by moving all IndexedDB writes into a single Dexie transaction instead of spawning competing inner transactions ([#1876](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1876)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `getAccountProof` in the `RpcClient`, accepting optional `AccountStorageRequirements` and block number parameters to fetch specific storage maps without full account reconstruction ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1917)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `syncStorageMaps` in the `RpcClient` for paginated retrieval of large storage maps ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1917)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `storage_details()` and `find_map_details()` accessors to `AccountProof` for direct access to storage map data ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1917)).

## 0.13.2 (2026-02-26)

* Updated to `miden-crypto` v0.19.5 ([#1813](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1813)).
* [FIX] Stopped including unnecessary storage map data when loading existing accounts for transaction execution. New accounts (nonce == 0) still get full storage maps as needed for kernel validation ([#1832](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1832)).
* [FIX][web] Added missing `attachment()` getter to `NoteMetadata` WASM binding ([#1810](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1810)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed transaction execution failures after reopening a browser extension by always persisting MMR authentication nodes during sync, even for blocks with no relevant notes. Previously, closing and reopening the extension lost in-memory MMR state and the store was missing nodes needed for Merkle authentication paths. Also surfaces a distinct `PartialBlockchainNodeNotFound` error instead of a confusing deserialization crash when nodes are missing ([#1789](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1789)).

## 0.13.1 (2026-02-13)

* Added the `@miden-sdk/react` hooks library (see [its own changelog](https://github.com/0xMiden/web-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)) ([#1711](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1711)).
* Fixed WASM bindings consuming JS objects: `RpcClient` and `WebClient` methods now take references (`&AccountId`, `&Word`) instead of owned values, so callers can reuse objects after passing them ([#1765](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1765)).
* Fixed `AccountSmtForest` pruning shared SMT roots between old and new account states, which caused `MerkleError::RootNotInStore` during note screening after `sync_state()` ([#1771](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1771)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `setupLogging(level)` and `logLevel` parameter on `createClient` to route Rust tracing output to the browser console with configurable verbosity ([#1669](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1669)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added 3-layer concurrency safety for WASM access: in-tab async lock, cross-tab IndexedDB lock, and auto-sync on cross-tab state changes ([#1784](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1784)).

* Expanded the `GrpcClient` API with methods to fetch account proofs and rebuild the slots for an account ([#1591](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1591)).
* [BREAKING] `WebClient.addAccountSecretKeyToWebStore` now takes an additional parameter: an account ID. This will link the ID with the secret key in the WebStore. Added `WebClient.getPublicKeyCommitmentsOfAccount` method that will return a list of related public key commitments for the given account ID ([#1608](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1608)).
* [BREAKING] Added naming to `IndexedDB` store to allow multiple WebClient instances to run in the same browser; `WebClient.createClient` now takes an optional DB name (otherwise defaults to name based on the endpoint/network) ([#1645](https://github.com/0xMiden/rust-sdk/pull/1645)).
